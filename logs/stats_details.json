Arguably, when numbering my fruit cups, I left the best till last. (I skipped number 16 because the number 7 so befits a Tennessee whiskey-based cocktail). If using a 40% alc./vol. Tennessee whiskey (as opposed to a higher alc./vol. special bottling) then this recipe benefits from an extra splash (5ml (1/6oz) to 10ml (1/3oz).

Virtually every bar in Canada can make you a Bloody Caesar, it's pretty much Canada's national drink. It may seem odd that a drink invented in Canada took the name of Rome's most famous emperor, but though its origins are Canadian its inspiration is very much Italian. Charged with inventing a signature drink to celebrate the opening of Marco's Italian restaurant at the Calgary Inn in 1969, Walter Chell was inspired by the flavours of Spaghetti Vongole (spaghetti with clams) and named his new cocktail after the Roman emperor. The typical finish to what Canadians simply call a Caesar is to wet the rim with lemon juice and then dip the glass in celery salt. However, the Caesar actually lends itself to an array of garnishes. Celery and a lime wedge are more traditional, but since the Caesar has become so popular, restaurants and bars have felt the need to customise the garnish to make their version unique, adopting anything from olives and peppers to pickled asparagus and shrimp. Some drinks end up looking more like an appetiser! I've gone for the elegant and deliciously crunchy green bean to garnish ours.",

    "response": "Sometimes called a Gaelic Coffee and properly known by its Irish name 'Caife Gaelach', the Irish Coffee is traditionally served in a stemmed heatproof glass known as a toddy glass and comprises hot filter coffee, Irish whiskey and sugar (preferably brown sugar) topped with lightly whipped cream. The sweetened whiskey-laced coffee should be topped with a luxurious moustache inducing inch thick layer of cream to sip through. To ensure your cream floats rather than sinks into the coffee, lightly whip, shake, or blend your cream before pouring over the bowl of a spoon. It also helps if the cream and the spoon are gently warmed. Sweetening the coffee with sugar also amplifies the drink's flavours and helps the cream float. I prefer to use demerara or muscovado sugar syrup .. The history of alcoholic hot coffee drinks topped with cream dates back to the mid-19th Century with the best-known examples being the Fiaker and Pharisäer served in Viennese coffee houses. By the turn of the 20th-century variations called Kaisermelange, Maria Theresia and Biedermeier-Kaffee could also be found on menus at Viennese coffee houses. Combining coffee and spirits was also popular in 19th-century France where such drinks were called a Gloria. The relatively modern Irish Coffee (originally named Sheridan's Gaelic Coffee) was created in late 1944 - early 1945 by Joe Sheridan, a chef turned bartender originally from Castlederg, County Tyrone while working at Foynes' Port. Sheridan added whiskey to hot coffee to warm a group of American passengers disembarking from a Pan Am flying boat at Foynes on a cold and wet winter evening. The passengers are said to have asked if they were being served Brazilian coffee to which Sheridan answered, \" It's an Irish coffee \". Early planes lacked sufficient flying range to make Atlantic crossings and from 1937 onwards, flying boats were used to make the journey with Foynes' Port on the west coast of Ireland the last refuelling point for the Sikorsky S-42 and Boeing 314 planes. The first non-stop New York service started on 22 June 1942 and took 25 hours 40 minutes. The planes were comparatively primitive and the flight was arduous so the restorative boozy coffees were well received by cold weary travellers. The demise of Foynes Port was sealed in 1942 with the opening of nearby Shannon Airport, built on bogland on the northern bank of the Estuary. Foynes Flying Boat Museum is all that remains of the old port but the tradition of serving Irish Coffees to transatlantic travellers continued at the new airport, and it is here, in 1947, that Stanton Delaplane , a travel writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, enjoyed his first Irish Coffee. Back home in San Francisco, at one of his favourite local bars, the Buena Vista Café (purportedly late on 10th November 1952), Delaplane recounted travel stories to Jack Koepple, the bar owner, and the two of them set about trying to recreate Sheridan's Gaelic Coffee. Despite numerous attempts, the drink did not quite taste right and the cream would not float. This prompted Koepple to travel to Shannon Airport to see how the drink was made. Upon returning back to San Francisco he continued his experimentation and also discussed the issues he was having floating the cream with the city's mayor, who was also a dairy owner. Koepple discovered that the cream whipped better and so floated when it was two days old rather than being fresh. After further experimentation, Koepple arrived at the method, recipe and 6oz heat-treated goblet still used at the Buena Vista today, where some 2,000 Irish Coffees are reputedly sold every day.. 0: .. 6: .. 8: .",

Some also added soda to turn this cocktail into a long drink. Then the popularity of the Milano Torino led to red bitter liqueur (e.g. Campari) being used in preference to amari in an Americano.

    "response": "Pisco Sour (Difford's recipe). All the Peruvian bartenders I've met prefer their Pisco Sours blended rather than shaken. Indeed, it is a brilliant cocktail when blended, but I prefer my Pisco Sours shaken. (In Cuba, Daiquiris also tend to be blended, but I also prefer these shaken.) While some like to omit the egg white, like most sour-style cocktails the Pisco Sour is better with egg, although half the white of a small fresh egg white is plenty (around 15ml/½oz to 20ml/⅔ ). Some also advocate the use of powdered sugar in place of caster sugar syrup, and indeed, this can add to this sour (like the Daiquiri). In which case, you'll need 3 spoons (5ml sized measuring bowl) of powdered sugar in place of the syrup. More worthy of debate is the choice of pisco. My Peruvian friends favour pisco made from the Quebranta grape or even an acholado (a blend of varieties). However, I prefer to use Peruvian pisco made from the more aromatic Italia grape, preferably mosto verde Italia pisco. Alternatively, there are also good-value Chilean pisco alternatives. Convention has it that the Pisco Sour is garnished with three drops of aromatic bitters symmetrically deposited onto its foaming head. This not only adds to the visual appearance, but the aroma of the bitters also helps mask the wet dog-like smell of egg white. Angostura or similar aromatic bitters are fine, but for authenticity, consider using Peruvian Amargo Chuncho bitters, which are based on various Amazonian barks and herbs. Some also dust the surface of the cocktail or the rim of the glass with cinnamon. Somewhat controversially, if the use of Italia pisco is not enough, I also like to add a dash of orange flower water to my Pisco Sours. I also tend to serve them straight-up in a frozen, heavy-bottomed old-fashioned glass to help lengthen the time the cocktail stays ice cold, but a frozen coupe also works well (and looks better in photos). Lastly, I used to specify only lime juice, but I now favour a lime-heavy split between lime and lemon juice. That said, 22.5ml (¾oz) lime juice yields a very tasty, more straightforward cocktail.. One serving of Pisco Sour (Difford's recipe) contains 155 calories. Select and pre-chill a Coupe glass .. Prepare garnish of Amargo Chuncho bitters or other aromatic bitters..

Bar legend says the Southside (or South Side) was created during Prohibition , either at a New York City speakeasy called Jack & Charlie's, or at Manhattan's Stork Club, or by Chicago's Southside mobsters to make their bootleg liquor more palatable, while on the other side of town hoodlums enjoyed the Northside (gin and ginger ale).
