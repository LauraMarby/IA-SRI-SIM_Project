  "Review": "Despite the name, this Old Fashioned style drink is more fruity and nutty than it is woody, but it's tasty all the same.",
  "History": "Created in 2015 by Gary Anderson at Gingers Bar at Purnell's Bistro, Birmingham, England, who says, \"The drink came from wanting to make a cognac Old Fashioned (hence a l'ancienne). The maple, griottines and Peychaud's bitters were introduced to keep the idea of the cocktail being very French. Bizarrely, the walnut came from attempting a Google search for \"maple and cherry\" which displayed an antique wood specialist who along with maple and cherry wood also used walnut. Therefore my drink became \"A Woody Old Fashioned\" or \"A L'Ancienne du Bois\". Old-Fashioned cocktail history",
