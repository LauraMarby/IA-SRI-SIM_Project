  "Review": "\"Two inspirations: one of history, and one of a grandmother's love. \"Catalizador is inspired by a long and untold history between rum and tea that incited the American Revolution. What most people believed to have started with a tax on tea actually began with discord created by a tax on rum in 1733. \"The second inspiration for the Catalizador came from my grandmother's natural remedy for my hyperthyroidism. She introduced me to camomile and its calming properties alleviated my condition. \"So, rum and tea were the CATALYST for the war leading the Americans to their freedom, tea was the CATALYST in aiding a heart condition, and BACARDÍ was the CATALYST that inspired and continues to inspire bartenders to create a whole new genre of light, crisp, refreshing, and legacy-worthy cocktails.\"",
