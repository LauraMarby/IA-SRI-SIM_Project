  "Review": "Classically an equal parts three-ingredient cocktail comprising: 30ml rye, 30ml bitter liqueur and 30 ml dry vermouth. This produces an overly dry bittersweet spirituous drink. Hence, I prefer the Old Pal with an even split of dry and bianco vermouths so introducing a fourth ingredient and the merest touch more sweetness to tame this Negroni -style sipper.",
  "History": "A rye whiskey-based version of the Boulevardier cocktail , the Old Pal first appears in Harry MacElhone's 's 1927 Barflies and Cocktails . Not among the book's A-Z listing of recipes, but in a chapter titled \"Cocktails Round Town\", written by Arthur Moss, the \"Around the Town\" columnist of the New York Herald, Paris . Named and modelled after his newspaper column, Moss recounts cocktails created by or for other regulars at Harry's Bar . (For more on Moss and his contribution, see the Boulevardier cocktail.)",
