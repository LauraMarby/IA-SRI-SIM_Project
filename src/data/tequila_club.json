  "Review": "The similarity of ingredients in this tequila-based riff on the classic Pegu Club to the Margarita are obvious, so it's not surprising the finished drink is reminiscent of a Margarita, only lighter with the lime notes a lot subtler. As well as the tequila, orange curaçao shines in this drink.",
