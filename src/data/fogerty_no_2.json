  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2010 by Ryan 'Jesus' Fitzgerald at Beretta in San Francisco, USA. According to my notes, when at Beretta in 2010, Ryan's original recipe comprised 60ml (2oz) Rye whisky, 15ml (½oz) Campari, 7.5ml (¼oz) crème de cassis, and 2 dash orange bitters.  However, it transpires that Ryan's Fogerty is made with white crème de cacao and not crème de cassis.",
