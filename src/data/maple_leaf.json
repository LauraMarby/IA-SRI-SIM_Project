  "Review": "Anything from 10ml (1/3oz) to 15ml (1/2oz) maple syrup works in this recipe, depending on your maple syrup, lemons and personal taste. I've gone for the middle of the road at 12.5ml as for me the trio combines wonderfully with the maple syrup still in something of a supporting role.",
  "History": "The Maple Leaf cocktail first appeared in Frank Meier's 1936 book The Artistry of Mixing Drinks and I suspect it originated in the USA or even the UK due to its being based on bourbon whiskey. If it had been created by a Canadian, where the maple leaf is very much a national symbol, then it's likely a Canadian rye whisky, arguably more appropriate, would have been used.",
