  "Review": "Gin and herbal vermouth with zippy zesty orange. My previous recipe comprised 30ml (1oz) gin, 15ml (½oz) orange curaçao, 30ml (1oz) rosso (sweet) vermouth, 45ml (1½oz) orange juice, and 1 dash orange bitters. In a quest for a recipe closer The Savoy's original, in January 2023, I amended to the above recipe – hopefully for the better.",
