  "Review": "“To honour the heritage of my country, I have combined the legacy of BACARDÍ rum – unchanged since it was first crafted in 1862 - with the legacy of King Richard ‘The Lionheart’ who served the aged dessert wine Commandaria at his wedding in Cyprus. “Paying homage to the legacy of the crusaders with Don Facundo’s, together with the original recipe of the BACARDÍ Daiquiri, one of the most known cocktails in the world has produced my legacy cocktail; a very elegant drink with a silky texture, a drink to share - the ‘Noble Daiquiri’!”",
