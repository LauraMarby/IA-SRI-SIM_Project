The light, universal taste of Bacardí rum is known all over the world. We each stand every day before the same opportunity as Facundo - a chance to build our own legacy. In order to achieve it, you need flavours that can inspire. Bacardí Carta Oro, with its vanilla notes, is a perfect match for apricot, lemongrass, lime, and allspice. Create your own legacy! \"",
