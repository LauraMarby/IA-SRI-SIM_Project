  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2015 by Timothy Eshing who says \" 'Le Coq d'Or' means 'the golden rooster' (hence the use of 'golden' ingredients); it is the title of a 1907 opera by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, after a story by Pushkin, itself after a story by Irving. Outside Russia, the work is usually performed in French (hence the name and reliance on French ingredients). Each major ingredient is associated with a major character in the opera: the cognac and liqueur for the Tsar and Tsaritsa, the fruit juices for the Tsar's two doomed sons, the yolk for the golden rooster, and the bitters for the astrologer. \"",
