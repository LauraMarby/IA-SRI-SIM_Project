  "Review": "Chartreuse notes show strongly in this short refreshing cocktail, with cognac providing the base and lemon juice contributing to freshening citrus balance.",
  "History": "The Brandy Daisy appears in Jerry Thomas' 2nd edition of his Bar-Tender's Guide (1887) and then the 2nd edition of Harry Johnson's Bartenders Manual (1888). Tellingly, both bartenders omit the Brandy Daisy, and indeed Daisies in general from their first editions. We prefer Johnson's recipe.",
