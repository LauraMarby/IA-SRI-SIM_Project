  "Review": "\"I feel that the untameable spirit of Bacardí lives everywhere in nature: truffles, ginseng and herbs all grow out of extremely difficult environments. Just like bartenders, we work at night, are wild, free-spirited, untamed, we pass on positive energy and share good vibes with people, bringing our own distinct flair and 'flavours' to light up the bar; so I believe we bartenders are indeed 'black gold.'\" We say : A honey daiquiri with herbal spice courtesy of Bénédictine and ginseng aperitif. Depending on your ginseng aperitif (we used Kamm & Son but unlikely to be what they use in China) you may want to make that barspoon of honey slightly heaped rather than flat.",
