  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created by Scott Diaz in Seattle, Washington State, USA. The phrase \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\" is first attributed to English poet Ernest Dowson (1867-1900) as part of a February 1899 letter to Arthur Moore. However, it was another poet, Thomas Haynes Bayly, who popularised the phrase in his poem Isle of Beauty published in his two-volume 1844 Songs, Ballads, and Other Poems .",
