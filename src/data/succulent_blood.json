  "Review": "Mezcal and blood orange juice with sweet spice added with cinnamon syrup and clove-rich falernum.",
  "History": "Created in February 2014 by yours truly after misreading the recipe for the Sangre Dulce cocktail by Regina Butler at Blackbird Bar in San Francisco. I used Velvet Falernum in place of Fernet Vallet but the resulting drink tasted good. Then, in May 2022, updated to add a splash of lime juice thanks to a comment by Ulysses Grand. Mezcal is distilled from agave plants which are categorised 'Succulents' - plants which are thickened and fleshy, allowing them to retain water in arid climates - hence, coupled with blood orange juice, this cocktail's name.",
