  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2015 by Liam Baer at Fish and Meat in Hong Kong. (Our thanks to Kshitiz Gurung at Stockton, Hong Kong for passing on this recipe.) This drink takes its name from the eponymous honey badger, a carnivorous animal which despite its name bears more resemblance to an oversized weasel or polecat than it does to other members of the badger species. It is native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The original recipe uses rosemary-infused bourbon* and homemade ginger syrup**. *Rosemary infused bourbon: Drop 6 fresh rosemary sprigs into a bottle of bourbon. Leave to infuse for 48 hours shaking occasionally, then strain and rebottle. **Ginger syrup: Stir 1/3 cup water and ½ cup brown sugar and in a saucepan and gently heat until sugar is dissolved. Transfer the brown sugar syrup you have made into a blender and add 1 cup peeled and chopped fresh ginger. Blend into a paste and strain to remove solids. Bottle and refrigerate.",
