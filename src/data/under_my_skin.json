  "Review": "\"I wanted to create a drink that is easy to make using ingredients that are available around the World. The basic inspiration was the classic BACARDÍ Daiquiri, for me one of the best drinks ever invented. The name \"Under My Skin\" is inspired firstly by the ingredients that, when combined, will get under your skin; secondly by the Frank Sinatra song \"Under My Skin\" about a woman he can never get enough of. This is the impression I wanted to create with this drink.\"",
