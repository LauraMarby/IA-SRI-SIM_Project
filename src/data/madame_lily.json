  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Noam Sharet at A23 Local Blend in Tel Aviv, Israel. Noma's original recipe calls for 22.5 ml (3/4oz) simple (1:1) sugar syrup. We swapped for richer 2:1 and we also found adding a dash or two of absinthe works well in place of absinth rinsing.",
