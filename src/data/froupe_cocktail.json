  "Review": "A bittersweet, herbal old-school drink that's in line for rediscovery.",
  "History": "It transpires (many thanks to Ian Fenton for pointing this out) that what we now know as the \"Froupe\" cocktail was originally named \"Fioupe\" and the spelling change most likely came about due to a mistake in its translation from this cocktail's first known appearance in Carlo Beltramo's 1924 Carlo's Cocktail et Boissons Américaines written in French. This explains that the cocktail was named after \"Mr. Fioupe\", who \"was, before the war, a well-known figure all along the Riviera.\"",
