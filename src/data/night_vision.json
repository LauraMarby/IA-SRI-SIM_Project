  "Review": "Cachaça, carrot and tonic water make for a very interesting combo in this cocktail. Perhaps more health shop/juice bar than speakeasy, but unusually tasty all the same.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink originally called \"Natural\" created in 2015 by Jorge Balbontin, Barcelona, Spain. Carrots are packed full of Vitamin A, in the form of beta carotene, so are good for the health of our eyes, but contrary to popular belief, carrots don't help you see in the dark. This urban myth stems from WWII. During the 1940 Blitzkrieg, the Luftwaffe struck the southeast of England under the cover of darkness, but the Royal Air Force had the upper hand in the dark skies due to new radar technology. First installed in RAF aircraft in 1939, the secret onboard Airborne Interception Radar (AI) could spot enemy bombers before they reached the English Channel. Not wanting the Germans to develop similar technology, to explain the success of the British pilots, the Ministry of Information spread the myth that they could see in the dark due to eating carrots.",
