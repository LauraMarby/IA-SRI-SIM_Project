  "Review": "Bittersweet and Martini in style but with the hard edges smoothed and a hint of eastern spice added. Perhaps more a digestivo than an aperitivo.",
  "History": "Created in 2008 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England. James Bond named his favourite style of Martini ( Vesper ) after the beautiful Russian agent Vesper Lynd. This version is 'Reversed' due to the dramatically increased ratio of aromatised wines . Fittingly, my cocktail mixes East and West European ingredients with the introduction of Becherovka. And where there is Becherovka, there should be tonic water (see Be-ton ). I originally made this with 5ml of homemade pomegranate syrup to add much-needed sweetness (to counter kina bitterness) as a fitting blood-like syrup. Swapping to commercial grenadine added too much colour and flavour; hence, now equal parts sugar and grenadine syrup.",
