  "Review": "This long refreshing fruity cocktail mimics the characteristics of a Pimm's Cup but with the punch and fullness flavour, reminiscent of distant decades when Pimm's No.1 carried a full 9% more alc./vol. than it does today. Predictably, my version is a good deal boozier. If you find too boozy for a summer's afternoon, then knock each of the first 3 ingredients back a tad to (22.5ml / .75oz) and add a splash more of the last 2 ingredients.",
  "History": "Created in 2011 by yours truly in an attempt to improve on a Pimm's Cup. For more recipes and history see Fruit Cups and Pimm's .",
