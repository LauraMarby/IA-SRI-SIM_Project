  "Review": "A classic Daiquiri with aged rum and a hint of chocolate.",
  "History": "Thought to have been created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert at Havana's Floridita bar, but in the Cuban book Bartender's Sixth Sense , the Mulata is said to have been created in the 1940s by one Jose Maria Vazquez. This cocktail was originally made with Bacardi Elixir , a liqueur made by infusing plums in rum, but since the 1970s crème de cacao liqueur has been used as a substitute. Production of Bacardi Elixir ended when Bacardi was forced to leave Cuba, but a small batch of around 60 bottles was made to celebrate Bacardi Legacy Competition in April 2013.
