  "Review": "This brandy-influenced Sweet Manhattan is best mixed by throwing and enjoyed while bubbles still rest on its surface.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe in the posthumously published 1887 Jerry Thomas' Bar-tenders Guide ( Jerry \"The Professor\" Thomas died 15th December 1885). The cocktail takes its name from Saratoga Springs, a city in New York State, which became a popular resort town due to its natural mineral springs and the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad, which opened in 1832. Hotels sprang up, and Saratoga was \"the 19th century's east coast equivalent of Las Vegas.\" In its day, the city's Grand Union Hotel was the largest in the world.",
