  "Review": "This is how we prefer our margaritas to be served. Tangy citrus and tequila with a hint of balancing sweetness and a faint salty undertone. We also prefer the subtlety of half a pinch of salt in the drink to a salt laden glass rim.",
  "History": "The traditional Margarita recipe is 2 parts tequila, 1 part triple sec and 1 part lime juice. This produces a drink which is a tad on the sour side with the sweetness of the triple sec not quite balancing the sourness of the lime. Hence, depending on the sourness of the limes, I like to add a spoon (5ml) of agave syrup to boost flavour and improve the drink's balance. See: Margarita cocktail history .",
