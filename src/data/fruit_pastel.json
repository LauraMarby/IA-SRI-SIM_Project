  "Review": "Tastes distinctly like a Fruit Pastille sweet.",
  "History": "Created in late October 2005 by Darren Thrush at the Fourth Floor Cafe and Bar at Harvey Nichols in Leeds, England. To quote Darren, \" The martini glass must have a sugared rim to enhance the presentation and the sweet concept. What's amazing about this concept is that the colour represents what is probably everybody's favourite flavour fruit pastille - the blackcurrant one. \"",
