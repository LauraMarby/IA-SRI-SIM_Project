  "Review": "Reminiscent of an aged rum-based Espresso Martini (and yes it works when made with freshly brewed espresso coffee rather than cold brew). Fernet Branca and falernum add depth of flavour and their own distinctive personality. A great after-dinner cocktail. The salt influence is subtler than the name might suggest.",
