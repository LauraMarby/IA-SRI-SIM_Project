  "Review": "\"The inspiration behind this cocktail goes beyond the drink and the person mixing it. Each ingredient represents a unique characteristic we all possess. It is the combination of these, at perfect equilibrium, that creates a harmonious symphony that touches everybody. Finding the balance between simplicity and complexity and being able to convey this within context, is a battle we all face. The content and concept is intended to arouse a sense of clarity, excitement and understanding that anything is attainable. In essence, a Dream Catcher.\"",
