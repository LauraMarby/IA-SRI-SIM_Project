  "Review": "\"Amado means 'sweetheart;' the inspiration behind my drink is my own romantic love story which began with a sour note like lime, but finished with the sweet fragrance of my dream girl, like rose syrup. Of course, it had some bitter times too which seasoned our life and brought us closer, just like the Angostura in this drink. And Bacardí, which is the soul of my cocktail. If this drink soothes your palate, it's a cocktail; but if it soothes your soul, it's a LEGACY.\" We say : A rose flavoured daiquiri - what's not to like? We followed the recipe using Monin rose syrup but the result was too sweet and floral. Then we tried 10ml which was a tad too sour. Bang in the middle hit the spot but then we started playing around with Turkish rose water and sugar syrup before remembering this was somebody else's recipe. Cries out for a Turkish delight as a garnish.",
