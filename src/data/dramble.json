  "Review": "Basically, a whisky sour served over crushed ice with a dash of rich crème de mûre. For whisky drinkers this Scotch whisky riff on Dick Bradsell 's classic Bramble is even better than the original gin based cocktail.",
  "History": "Created in 2013 by Jacob Briars at Aberfeldy Distillery during a tasting session, this is a Dewar's whisky twist on the on the Bramble, hence the name Dramble. The name is also fitting as Tommy Dewar, one of the two brothers who built the Aberfeldy Distillery and the Dewar's whisky brand, being known for his Ramble Round the Globe book, so there's a pun at play there too.",
