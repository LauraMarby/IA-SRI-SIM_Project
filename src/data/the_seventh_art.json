  "Review": "Confronted by a wide choice of popcorn at the supermarket I opted for Metcalfe's Honey Bee flavoured popcorn. The honey notes on the corn are very subdued and I wanted to avoid salted popcorn. As for the cocktail, tiny oily droplets from the sweetcorn form a layer on the surface of the drink and as you raise the glass to your lips the aroma of popcorn is surprisingly noticeable. Chartreuse slightly overwhelms the sweetcorn in what is a very enjoyable, Daiquiri -style cocktail.",
