  "Review": "This lavender pink drink is everything you (or your partner) might want for a Valentine's tipple. It is the right colour, includes parfait amour liqueur (meaning perfect love) and the all-important champagne sparkle. Good luck. In case he/she asks, parfait amour is a lilac coloured curaçao (orange) liqueur flavoured with rose petals, vanilla pods and almonds.",
