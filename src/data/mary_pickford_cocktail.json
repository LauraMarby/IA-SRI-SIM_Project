  "Review": "When made correctly, this pale-pink cocktail has a perfect balance between the fruit flavours and the spirit of the rum.",
  "History": "Created in the 1920s (during Prohibition) by Fred Kaufman at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, for the silent movie star and wife of Douglas Fairbanks. Mary was in Cuba filming a movie with her husband and his best friend, Charlie Chaplin. This is recounted on page 40 of Basil Woon's 1928 book When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba , \" The Mary Pickford, invented during a visit to Havana of the screen favourite by Fred Kaufman, is two-thirds pineapple-juice and one-third Bacardi, with a dash of grenadine. Both cocktails [ The Presidenté is also mentioned] are sweetish and should be well shaken. The pineapple juice must be fresh-squeezed. \" Thus, it would appear that the dash of maraschino liqueur, now viewed as an essential ingredient, is a later addition to the Mary Pickford.",
