  "History": "Legend has it that the Mudslide was created at the Wreck Bar & Grill in Rum Point Club on Grand Cayman Island, although the bar's own website says, \"It may have been born elsewhere in the world but we have claimed it as our own!  We are the home of the mudslide!\" As for the story behind the legend, the folk at the Wreck say: \" Our legend of the Rum Point Mudslide comes from the 1970s when guests came to the bar and asked the bartender for a white Russian.  The bartender asked the ingredients; well it is simple vodka, Kahlua and cream. Well the bartender replied, I have Vodka and Kahlua but I don't have any cream but how about some of this Bailey's Irish cream.  And thus the mudslide was born at the Wreck Bar at Rum Point Club... \"There have been many variations created over the years and rumor has it that the original trials of this illusive libation contained Vanilla Hagan Daz ice cream.  The mudslide recipe was tweaked and the recipe at Rum Point has stayed as it is since the 1980's and served as is it now with Absolut Vodka, Kahlua and Bailey's or Molly's Irish cream a and ice.  No fillers, no ice cream nor chocolate, and garnished with cinnamon, a cherry and a shot of Kahlua down the straw!\"",
