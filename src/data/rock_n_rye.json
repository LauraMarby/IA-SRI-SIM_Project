  "Review": "Great rye whiskey notes with hints of orange and cherry. Slightly sweet but all too easy to quaff.",
  "History": "Rock & Rye is a generic term for a style of traditional American liqueur made with a rye whiskey base infused with fruit and sugar, often bottled with pieces of fruit in the bottle. This was inspired by the flavour of one of these liqueurs: Jacquin's Rock & Rye, produced by Charles Jacquin et Cie Inc. , \"America's Oldest Cordial Producer\" until circa 2009. Classically, a \"Rock & Rye Cocktail\" is mixed with rock & rye liqueur as an ingredient. For example, Stanley M. Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide includes a Rock & Rye Cocktail, a Rock & Rye Cooler, and a Rock & Rye Toddy, all made with rock & rye liqueur as an ingredient.",
