  "Review": "Traditionally made with equal parts gin, Green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice but, like like many others, (when using a 40%-43% alc./vol. gin,) I like to slightly increase the proportion of gin. Chartreuse devotes will love this balanced, tangy cocktail. I'm one!",
  "History": "The earliest known written reference to the Last Word is among a list of cocktail names in a souvenir menu sent to members of the Detroit Athletic Club with the club's July-August 1916 issue of its magazine. There is no accompanying recipe, just the cocktail's name and its respective price among the other cocktails listed. At 35 Cents, the Last Word is twice the price of a Manhattan. The Last Word's link to the Detroit Athletic Club is affirmed by notes accompanying the recipe in Ted Saucier's 1951 book Bottoms Up! .",
