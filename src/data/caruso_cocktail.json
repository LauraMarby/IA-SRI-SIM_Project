  "Review": "Emerald green with full-on mint. Good as a digestif after a tenor-sized meal. This was originally a shaken drink and despite modern-day convention, we prefer this drink opened and cooled by a vigorous shake. If all those bubbles upset you, then perhaps throw or, as a last resort stir.",
