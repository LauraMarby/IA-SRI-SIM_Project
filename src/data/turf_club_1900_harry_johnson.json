  "Review": "Despite the maraschino liqueur, this Martini-style cocktail is dry and punchy.",
  "History": "Harry Johnson, tellingly, doesn't list the Turf cocktail in the 1882 first edition or the 1888 second edition of his Bartenders' Manual but does include it as the last drink in his revised 1900 New and Improved edition. Johnson reflects on changing tastes and fashions by calling for Plymouth gin rather than old tom gin in his turn-of-the-century recipe.",
