  "Review": "Irish whiskey with herbal complexity and zesty orange.",
  "History": "Created in 2004 by David Wondrich in Brooklyn, New York City, USA. By popular demand (well, an email and one comment on this website) in June 2020, I reduced the whiskey in this recipe from 60ml to 50ml. (Hope you don't mind David?). However, my own preference is for the original 60ml whiskey but with 15ml Lillet Blanc, 15ml Americano Bianco, and 1 dash orange bitters.",
