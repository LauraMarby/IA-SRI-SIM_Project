  "History": "I merely added a splash of pisco to the classic Club Cocktail, which first appeared in W.C. Whitfield's 1939 Just Cocktails' book to arrive at this delicious recipe: 60 ml Cognac 7.5 ml Pisco 15 ml Maraschino liqueur 22.5 ml Pineapple juice 2 dash Peychaud's/Creole-style bitters While delicious, this recipe is boozy, so in June 2020, I rained this back to the recipe above.",
