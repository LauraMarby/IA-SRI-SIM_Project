  "Review": "A mint-influenced Whiskey Sour .",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2005 by Dale DeGroff for the opening of Bobby Flay's Bar American. Dale first published the recipe for this cocktail in his 2002 book The Craft Of The Cocktail , saying, \"For a tasty alternative, try substituting orange curaçao for the simple syrup.\" He repeats this recipe in the 2020 updated edition of the book, and both recipes call for the cocktail to be strained over crushed ice. However, the accompanying photograph in the 2020 edition is of the cocktail with cubed ice. We prefer cubed ice.",
