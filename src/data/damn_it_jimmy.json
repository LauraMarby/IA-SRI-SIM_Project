  "Review": "When made with Bacardi Carta Blanca (as it originally was), this delicate and so very slightly sweet cocktail has complex notes of blue cheese with faintly salty sherry and herbal dry vermouth complexity. It's perhaps the best cocktail I've created.",
  "History": "Created in August 2008 by yours truly. While pondering what to call it, the track I was listening to ended and one of the artists exclaimed, \"Damn it, Jimmy\", to his fellow band members, expressing how good the track was. My cocktail was named! Stupidly, I didn't record the name of that artist or, indeed, the album. Until December 2024, the paragraph above finished, \"Do you know it? That was when fellow Discerning Drinker Toby James commented, \"Found it...\" with a link to Another Day (Revised) on The Album Leaf. The studio chatter: \" Damnit Jimmy, that was some Something you did really smart Yeah So funny. Try one more time, just one, after this, just one \" Many thanks, James. Now I have an explanation for the name.",
