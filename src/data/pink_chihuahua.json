  "Review": "Yes, this appropriately named almond Margarita-like drink is pink and fluffy – due to being sweetened and made red with pomegranate syrup (in place of triple sec) and given a foamy head by the addition of egg white.",
  "History": "Created in 2010 by Dick Bradsell at The Pink Chihuahua at El Camion in London, England. This fluffy little pink drink is named Chihuahua (Spanish: Chihuahueño) after the smallest breed of dog and also the state of Mexico. At El Camion, the front door is painted with an artist's impression of a pink Chihuahua.",
