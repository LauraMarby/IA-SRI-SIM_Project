  "Review": "This drink's sweet-sour balance and degree of pink hue is relative to how generous you are with the grenadine. (When made with homemade fresh pomegranate syrup in place of grenadine, and you hit the perfect balance, this drink is delicious but sadly lacks the eponymous pink hue with the result being more golden-amber.)",
  "History": "The signature drink at the Polo Lounge, Beverly Hills Hotel, Los Angeles, USA. The hotel, which is lovingly termed the Pink Palace inspired The Eagles' Hotel California and graces the album cover.",
