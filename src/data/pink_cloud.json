  "Review": "To make this sweet after dinner drink I've used amaretto and pomegranate syrup in place of créme de noyaux. This almond flavoured liqueur made from apricot and peach stones is not currently available in the UK. US readers should use 2 shots of créme de noyaux in place of the first two ingredients.",
