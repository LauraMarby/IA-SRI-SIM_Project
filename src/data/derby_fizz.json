  "Name": "Derby Fizz",
  "Glass": "Fizz or Highball (8oz to 10oz)",
  "Ingredients": [
    "15 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)",
    "2 barspoon Powdered sugar (white sugar ground in mortar and pestle)",
    "60 ml Blended Scotch whisky",
    "7.5 ml Orange Curaçao liqueur",
    "15 ml Egg white",
    "60 ml Thomas Henry Soda Water"
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    "STIR lemon juice and sugar in base of shaker until sugar is dissolved. Add Scotch and orange curaçao, SHAKE with ice and strain back into shaker. DRY SHAKE (without ice) and slowly pour 2/3rds of the contents of the shaker from a higher than normal height into a chilled empty glass (no ice in glass) while simultaneously pouring soda with your other hand. The cocktail and soda should form a single stream of liquid falling into the glass.\r\n\r\nAs when pouring a Guinness, to achieve a perfect head on a Derby Fizz, the cocktail should be left to settle for at least a minute before topping off with what remains in the shaker. Ideally, during the settling period, the glass should be placed in a glass froster/fridge/freezer. As the final contents of the shaker are poured into the glass so the head should rise like a soufflé."

  "Review": "The \"Derby\" in the name may suggest Kentucky bourbon and that this fizz should be made with bourbon (indeed it can be), but the nuances of the orange curaçao fit better with Scotch whisky.",
  "History": "The Derby Fizz is said to first appear in the 1934 Old Mr. Boston Bartender's Guide , but it's not in the pamphlet-like 1934 edition I own. It is one of the cocktails mentioned in the \"supplementary list\" in the back of William James \"Billy\" Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Bar Book but alas without a recipe.",
