  "Review": "The fuzzy version of the rather better vodka-laced Hairy Navel . Why settle for a fuzzy navel when you can have a hairy one?",
  "History": "Inspired by the then-popular Screwdriver , the Fuzzy Navel was created in 1984 as part of a marketing campaign by National Distillers to support their launch of De Kuyper Original Peachtree in the USA. The name, with \"Fuzzy\" referring to the peach schnapps and \"navel\" to the orange juice, was the idea of the advertising agency engaged as part of the campaign. Helped by the ads, by 1985 The New York Times was reporting that first-year sales of 85,000 cases were forecast to rise to a million cases over that year.",
