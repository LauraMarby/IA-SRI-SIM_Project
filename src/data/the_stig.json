  "Review": "Whiter than white (actually \"white wine\" golden) yet mysterious. As for the taste, white wine acidity balances rich elderflower with spirituous lacing from apple brandy and aromatic grapey pisco. Should be stirred, but this cocktail does benefit from the dilution and aeration imparted by shaking.",
  "History": "Created in 2006 by yours truly at The Cabinet Room, London, England. Named partly for the 'St-G' on the screw cap of St-Germain elderflower liqueur and partly after The Stig , the mysterious white-clad racing driver on the BBC's Top Gear show.",
