  "History": "Thanks to a 2009 article by Dave Wondrich in The Malt Advocate we know that this cocktail was created in 1936 by a chap called George who was the head bartender at Baltimore's Emerson Hotel. The Preakness Stakes is an American horse race held on the third Saturday in May annually at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. George was the winner of a contest to come up with an official cocktail for the first Preakness Ball held that year. Incidentally, The Pimlico Racetrack is said to be named after Ben Pimlico's Tavern which once stood in the area.",
