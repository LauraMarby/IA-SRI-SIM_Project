  "Review": "\"The Milk shops in the early 1900s were the sellers of spirits during the Swedish prohibition era. The first milk shop ever opened in Stockholm was at the very same spot my bar, Corner Club, is located today. The order \"a box of browned butter\" was the code name for one wanting to buy booze. The bottles were concealed in butter in small wooden boxes and carried to your home in the open without any questions from the police. I wanted to find something truly Nordic that could not only reflect my geographical region, but also the bar I work at. Björn Frantzén is world famous for his food & one of his signature ingredients is browned butter.\" We say : Tastes great but I'm not sure how many people are going to make \"pineapple & browned butter syrup\".",
