  "Review": "A classic Dry Martini without bitters and garnished with cocktail onions in place of an olive or a twist. On those two distinctions, all are agreed. However, this cocktail's history and the best proportions of the two ingredients are topics of bar debate. I believe two different Mr Gibsons, a decade apart, were involved in creating and defining this cocktail. As for the proportions, I favour my go-to 5:1 Dry stirred Martini ratio .",
  "History": "As David Embury says in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , \" The distinction between the Martini and the Gibson is simple. The Martini is served with an olive, the Gibson with a small pickled cocktail onion. \" However, what differentiated a Gibson Martini was originally not its garnish but the lack of orange bitters in its recipe at a time when dashes of bitters in Martinis were the norm. The onion garnish came decades later. The first written reference to a Gibson appears in a piece written by Edward W. Townsend in the Sunday 13th February 1898 edition of New York's The World newspaper, titled \" Major Max Philosophizes. A Recent Society Function Discussed by the Major and His Wife. \" The salient section:",
