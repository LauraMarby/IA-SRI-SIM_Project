  "Review": "This short pisco-based spirituous stirred cocktail was inspired by memories of Nestle's Milkybars and the 1980s British TV ads featuring the Milkybar Kid promoting the white chocolate bars. White crème de cacao's sweetness is balanced by dry sherry and the acidity of Sauvignon Blanc wine, which also adds grassy floral notes. The discarded orange zest twist makes the first sip a white chocolate orange experience.",
