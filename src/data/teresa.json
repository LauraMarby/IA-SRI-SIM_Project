  "Review": "Previously, I've reduced the lime juice (to 20ml) and upped the cassis (to 30ml) in a quest to make this bittersweet 'n' sour aperitivo a touch more approachable. However, even then, the Teresa remains on the bitter and sour side, so I've reverted to the accepted spec from Gary \"gaz\" Regan's 2003 The Joy of Mixology .",
