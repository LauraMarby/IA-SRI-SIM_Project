  "History": "Adapted from a recipe discovered at Bastille Cafe & Bar in Seattle, USA. The Pastry War of 1838–39 between Mexico and France was fought after a French pastry chef living in Tacubaya, near Mexico City, claimed some Mexican army officers had damaged his restaurant. The chef was one of a number of foreign nationals who claimed they'd suffered losses as a result of civil disturbances, and their respective governments had unsuccessfully sought compensation on behalf of their nationals from the Mexican government. The chef's grievances pushed the French to the war to support his claim for 600,000 pesos and sent a fleet to the Mexican port of Veracruz. After bombarding the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa and occupying the city, thanks to a British-brokered peace, the French secured payment and withdrew their fleet. See: Margarita cocktail history",
