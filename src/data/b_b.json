  "Review": "Honeyed and spiced brandy. Traditionally mixed in equal parts proportions but I prefer slightly drier with a touch more brandy than  Bénédictine. The ice will add dilution with time but some, depending on the ice being used, may want to add 10ml (1/3oz) or more chilled water prior to mixing.",
  "History": "Bénédictine and various types of brandy have long been mixed together and combo first enters cocktail books in the early 1900s as a pousse-café layered cocktail with the brandy floated over the liqueur.",
