  "Review": "The dry cleansing balsamic vinegar alongside a good buttery Chardonnay and golden rum makes The Rum Pickle a great aperitivo. (Doesn't work nearly so well with a charcoal filtred light white rum.) Depending on your wine and vinegar, you may need to reduce the amount of vinegar, or up the amount of sugar to achieve a harmonious balance.",
