  "Review": "Recipes for this venerable Tiki classic vary enormously and are often confused with the Aku Aku which this drink morphed into at the hands of its creator, Donn Beach . The original recipe calls for peach brandy (distilled from fermented peaches) rather than peach liqueur (based on neutral spirit), but due to its clarity and clean flavour, I prefer peach schnapps as a substitute. Many recipes blend fresh mint and pineapple, and while blending the mint gives the drink a vibrant green colour, it does resemble stagnant pond water and looks like something you'd only drink for the promise of perceived health-giving properties rather than for pleasure. Hence, my version is shaken, but be sure to use generous amounts of mint to impart colour and flavour.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in the late 1930s by Donn Beach at his Don The Beachcomber restaurant in Hollywood, California, USA.",
