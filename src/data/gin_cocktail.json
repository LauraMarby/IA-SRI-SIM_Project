  "Review": "Bready genever with a hint of orange curaçao  adding flavour and the merest touch of sweetness balancing Boker's Bitters . If you don't have Boker's to hand then use the more widely stocked Peychaud's Bitters which produce a different but very tasty drink. I'd go as far as to suggest that Peychaud's produces better cocktail, one with an attractive pale shade of salmon pink – if you like that kind of thing.",
  "History": "A close relation to the Martinez, and so by default also the Martini, this cocktail is adapted from one of the oldest known cocktail recipes. Some say this recipe dates back to 1824, coincidentally the same year Dr Siegert created Angostura Bitters . However, the first known recipe appears in Jerry Thomas' 1862 The Bartender's Guide .",
