  "Review": "Please don't judge this recipe until you have experienced this fruity Daiquiri made homemade \"grenadine\" (1 part freshly pressed pomegranate juice and 2 parts caster sugar). Then you'll end up with a delicious cocktail with an off-white hue. With commercial grenadine syrup, this cocktail can have a jammy flavour and is likely to be bright cherry red - hardly a 'White' Lion. That said, some prefer cherry red and jammy!",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe purloined from David Embury's seminal 1948 book, The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks . Embury had a dry palate so we've added a spoon of sugar syrup to his recipe, which, depending on your palate, you may want to reduce or omit this. Embury does the While Lion an injustice by saying,  \" This, of course, is simply a White Lady without the egg white and with lime juice in place of lemon \". That might sum up his version but the original White Lion in Jerry Thomas' 1862 The Bar-tenders Guide is so much more.",
