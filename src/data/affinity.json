  "Review": "A spirituous aperitivo-style cocktail, or an after-dinner sipper, which can be made with numerous different sweet vermouths or indeed a vermouth amaro as per our recipe. Equal parts produces a balanced drink but those after a more spirituous cocktail may want to up the Scotch a tad. Also, consider using a single malt Scotch - your choice could dramatically change this drink's profile.",
