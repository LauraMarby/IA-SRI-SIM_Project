  "Review": "Basically a G&T with an extra pop of flavour, this has a broader appeal than the original Pink Gin .",
  "History": "When I sampled my first Pink Gin , made with generous dashes of bitters I found this classic tough to appreciate, so in 2002, I added another medicinal ingredient - tonic water, also containing quinine from cinchona bark. Or, looking at this another way, I simply added dashes of bitters to a G&T . I'm sure I wasn't the first to add Angostura Bitters to a G&T but I've not found an earlier reference to a \"Pink Gin & Tonic\". Others soon cottoned on and the gin graze, soda boom, and ready-to-drink market have combined to produce a plethora of pre-mixed Pink G&Ts as well as tonic waters specifically designed for such a serve. Hence, in 2021, I swapped out classic 'Indian' tonic water in this recipe for an aromatic tonic while also reducing the bitters dose accordingly.",
