  "Review": "A fruit cup is just not as fruity when made with any other spirit – yes cachaça is distilled from fermented sugar cane juice rather than fruit, but in this cocktail it seems to amplify fruity and sweet notes. While it may not go down well at Wimbledon, we're sure it would be a hit in Rio.",
