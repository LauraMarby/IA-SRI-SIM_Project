  "Review": "Similar to the Caipirovska in its use of vodka and lime, but the Dawa is sweetened with honey.",
  "History": "Inspired by the Brazilian Caipirinha and originally made and named during the 1980s at the Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi, this cocktail is particularly popular in upscale hotel bars in Kenya where it's enjoyed by the safari set. The name translates from Kiswahili as 'medicine'. It should be noted that in Kenya, a Dowa is also the name for a non-alcoholic drink made with honey, ginger and lime juice, made with hot water.",
