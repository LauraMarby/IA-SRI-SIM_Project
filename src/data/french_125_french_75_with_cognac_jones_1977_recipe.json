  "Review": "Jones' original 1977 built in the glass recipe, which consists: 2oz/60ml cognac, 1oz/30ml lemon juice and 2 spoons sugar, topped with champagne, is a powerful drink. Hence, we hope Jones would approve of our tweaking his recipe. The result still has plenty of oomph behind it, but with the extra dilution of shaking, is a tad more harmonious.",
  "History": "A cognac-based version of the gin-based French 75 cocktail , which was named after the French 75mm field gun used by the French army during WWI. This cognac version is appropriately named after another gun, the tank mounted Soviet 2A46 (also called D-81T) 125mm/L48 smoothbore cannon. This recipe is adapted from a recipe in Stanley M. Jones' 1977 book Jones Complete Barguide , modern French 125 recipes tend to be served straight-up in a flute glass. French 75 history and variations",
