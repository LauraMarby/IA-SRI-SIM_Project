  "Review": "Savoury, sweet n sour beer with enlivening chilli heat. On a hot day, if a beer is not refreshing enough, then a Michelada may hit the spot.",
  "History": "Loosely translates as \"my cold beer\" ( mi means 'my', chela is Mexican slang for pint/beer) and ada from helada is cold. This drink, which is popular in Mexico, is thought to have originated there sometime in the 1940s. There are many variations with Micheladas served with and without ice. It is usually served with light Mexican lager, although we prefer a darker beer. Even the spicy ingredients vary with Worcestershire sauce often omitted, but the hot pepper sauce remains a constant. In Mexico City itself, a Michelada almost always refers to something much simpler than this: 1 shot fresh lime juice in a glass with a salted rim, into which a light lager is poured.",
