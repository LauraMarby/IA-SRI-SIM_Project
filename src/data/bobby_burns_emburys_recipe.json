  "Review": "As Embury says, there would seem to be some sense in using a Scotch-based liqueur and although this version of the Bobby Burns is rarely seen, it is worthy of a trial.",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from David A. Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks . His Rob Roy and Bobbie Burns recipe reference a footnote below, \" An interesting variation of these drinks may be obtained by substituting Peychaud bitters for the Angostura. Peychaud, somehow seems to blend better than Angostura with the Scotch. \"",
