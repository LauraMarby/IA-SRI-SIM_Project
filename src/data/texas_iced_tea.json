  "Review": "Packing six different spirits,  this Texas Tea is basically a Long Island Iced Tea with bourbon, and packs a suitably large Texan punch, especially if made with 6 x 15ml (½oz) measures of spirit as per the original recipe. If so choose a large (14oz) Collins to accommodate sufficient cola to achieve the desired dilution.",
