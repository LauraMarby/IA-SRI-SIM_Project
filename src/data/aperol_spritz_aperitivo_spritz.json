  "Review": "Slightly sweet, herbal, refreshing and quaffable. The good folk at Aperol , the aperitivo liqueur brand most identified with the Spritz, recommend equal parts prosecco and liqueur topped with a splash of soda. However, we've stuck with our preferred 3:2:1 ratio which is a little lighter on aperitivo liqueur and noticeably fizzier. Hence, along with specifying how you want your steak done and preferred Dry Martini ratio, perhaps also stipulate your Spritz ratio.",
