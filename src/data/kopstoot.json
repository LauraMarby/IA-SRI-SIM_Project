  "Review": "In the worthy pursuit of responsible drinking I must stress that when enjoying a Kopstoot you should repeatedly take a sip from each glass – savour the combination rather than shooting the genever in one gulp.",
  "History": "The traditional Dutch way to drink genever, Kopstoot (pronounced 'Cop-Stoat') translates as 'headbutt'. The genever is served straight from a fridge or freezer in a small tulip-shaped glass and poured at the bar to fill the glass to the brim. The glass is filled to the extent that it can't be moved without causing spillage, and tradition dictates that the drinker bends down and takes the first sip of genever without touching the glass.",
