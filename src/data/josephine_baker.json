  "Review": "A smooth apricot and brandy dessert-style cocktail with hints of wine and cold tea.",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from a 1937 Bar Florida menu [later Floridita], Havana, Cuba. This cocktail is named in honour of Josephine Baker (1906-1975), an American-born dancer, singer, and actress. She dropped out of school at just 12 years old and lived as a street child amongst the slums of St. Louis until her street-corner dancing attracted attention, and at 15, she was recruited for the St. Louis Chorus vaudeville show. Baker became a hit in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, reputedly \"the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville\". In October 1925, she moved to Paris and starred at the Théâtre de Champs-Élysées where she appeared practically nude. Her erotic dancing earned her the nicknames Bronze Venus, Black Pearl and Créole Goddess. Baker was a staunch supporter of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and assisting the French Resistance during World War II earned her French military honour, the Croix de Guerre.",
