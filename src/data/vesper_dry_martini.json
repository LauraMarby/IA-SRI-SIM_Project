  "Review": "Yes, yes, it's a spirituous drink without fruit juices that best shows its crystalline beauty when stirred rather than shaken. However, it's the one Martini that no bartender should lecture a drinker who prefers, like James Bond, their Martinis \"shaken not stirred\". Vespers should be shaken! An action that aerates the cocktail, making it colder and more dilute than simply stirring. Surprisingly, shaking (rather than stirring) a Martini also amplifies the aromatised wine/vermouth . Shaking also gives the drink a slightly clouded appearance and can leave tiny shards of ice on the cocktail's surface. The clouded appearance impacts visual appeal, but the ice shards are easily removed using a fine strainer when pouring.",
  "History": "A cocktail with the name \"Vesper\" appears in William \"Cocktail Bill\" Boothby 's posthumously published 1934 World's Drinks And How To Mix Them (see below), but is very different to the Dry Martini variation that, thanks to James Bond's \"shaken, not stirred\", is so famous and revered today.",
