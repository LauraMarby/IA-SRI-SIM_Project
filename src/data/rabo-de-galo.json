  "Review": "The bittersweet herbal notes from the vermouth and Cynar combine harmoniously with the cachaça. Depending on how punchy you like your cocktails you may want to increase or decrease the amount of cachaça (anywhere between 45 and 60ml).",
  "History": "One of the best-known drinks in Brazil, Rabo de Galo originated in the mid-1950s after a Cinzano factory opened in São Paulo, leading to rosso (sweet) vermouth being mixed with the local cachaça. 'Rabo-de-galo' literally translates from Brazilian Portuguese as rooster tail or 'cock tail'. In Brazil, a cocktail is called 'coquetel'. Originally served as a shot in dive bars, which in Brazil are called pés-sujos (literally translates as 'dirty feet'), the proportions and the drink's ingredients vary greatly from bar to bar and region to region, but are generally accepted as being 2/3 cachaça and 1/3 sweet vermouth. In São Paulo, it is now commonplace for the vermouth to be substituted with Cynar, or (as above) both sweet vermouth and Cynar to be mixed with the cachaça. As the Rabo-de-Galo has transitioned from pés-sujos to cocktail bars, so it has moved from being served straight-up in large tall shot glasses to tumblers and on-the-rocks, as above.",
