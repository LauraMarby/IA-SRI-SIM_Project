  "Review": "Despite its soft salmon pink hue this cocktail is boozy with Irish whiskey and sherry to the fore. Oloroso sherry and dry vermouth balance each other harmoniously with red currant syrup adding flavour and richness.",
  "History": "Created in January 2016 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England. This cocktail combines elements from the two best-known vintage cocktails using groseille (redcurrant) syrup. The whiskey element comes from the Artist's Special while the kirsch, sherry and dry vermouth come from the Nineteen-Twenty .",
