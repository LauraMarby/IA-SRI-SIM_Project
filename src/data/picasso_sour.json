  "Review": "We were struck by the photograph that accompanied the recipe sent to us by this cocktail's creator. The photo was of the cocktail at Burj Al Arab in Dubai, where it is served with a tiny wooden artist's colour palate alongside a micro easel holding a print of Picasso's Portrait of The Absinthe Drinker . The cocktail itself is an artistic citrus-led riff on a Pisco Sour , but the original presentation amounts to true cocktail artistry.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2016 by Sean Halse at Gold On 27, Burj Al Arab, Dubai. Sean says, \"The drink was designed to show the artistic side of the modern bartender.\" (His original recipe called for 40ml Lapostelle Pisco and 10ml 1:1 sugar syrup.)",
