  "History": "Cointreau.com (the brand's official website) says, \" This is probably the first cocktail created in New York with Cointreau. \" It first appears in Hugo R. Ensslin's 1916-17 Recipes for Mixed Drinks and is named after the Deshler Hotel in Columbus, Ohio, one of three hotels owned by brothers Louis C. Wallick and Adrian L. Wallick. Ensslin worked at all three but spent most of his career in their The Wallick Hotel in Times Square where it is presumed he created this cocktail.",
