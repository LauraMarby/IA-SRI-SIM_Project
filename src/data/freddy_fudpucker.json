  "Review": "A Harvey Wallbanger made with tequila in place of vodka. Squeeze quality oranges just before making and you'll be amazed just how good this cocktail is. It's usual to build this drink and 'float' Galliano over the top. However, it's better to separately stir the tequila and orange and then strain over fresh ice. Then add the Galliano.",
  "History": "Basically a Harvey Wallbanger with tequila, this drink is thought to have been created in the mid-1960s by Donato 'Duke' Antone, the bartender also often credited for the Harvey Wallbanger itself. Read the full story and history of the Harvey Wallbanger .",
