  "Review": "The combination of honey and lemon suggests flu relief but don't wait for an ailment before trying this soothing concoction. The beneficial addition of a splash of orange juice to a Bee's Knees (classically it's just gin, lemon and honey) comes from David Embury's 1948 book The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks where he says, \" The addition of a small amount of orange juice makes for an interesting variation \".",
  "History": "For years, thanks to David A. Embury ,  the Bee's Knees was thought to have emerged in America during Prohibition when it was said the lemon juice and honey in this cocktail masked the poor quality of gin. However, the Bee's Knees actually originated on the other side of the Atlantic in Paris, France.",
