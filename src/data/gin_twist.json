In Sir Walter Scott's 1823 novel St Ronan's Well, the character Captain MacTurk says, \"Sir Binco, I will beg the favour of your company to the smoking-room, where we may have a cigar and a glass of gin-twist; and we will consider how the honour of the company must be supported and upholden upon the present conjuncture.\" William Makepeace Thackeray mentions the Gin Twist in his 1869 Miscellanies: The Book of Snobs. Sketches and Travels in London . \"About eleven men in white neckcloths drop in from dinner-parties, and show their lacquered boots and shirt-studs with a little complacency - and at midnight, after the theatres, the young rakes and viveurs come swaggering in, and call loudly for Gin-Twist.\"",
