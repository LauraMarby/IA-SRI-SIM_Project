  "Review": "Originally with a dash of sugar syrup but, thanks to a comment by Yacha Han on Difford's Guide,  presented here with maple syrup as a more appropriate sweetener. Whether you use sugar or maple syrup, both tame and amplify the flavour of the whiskey, but maple syrup contributes so much more. However, it's Fernet that dominates this Manhattan -style cocktail.",
  "History": "A previously forgotten classic resurrected in 2006 by Jamie Boudreau, Seattle, USA. The Toronto appears in David A. Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks but its earliest written incarnation is as the \"Fernet Cocktail\" in Robert Vermeire's 1922 Cocktails - How to Mix Them .",
