  "Review": "A very 'wet' but wonderfully Dry Martini which demands an olive, not a twist. Before you start - Craddock calls for it to be shaken, but it's better stirred. Shaking tends to suit Martinis with a low vermouth ratio.",
  "History": "First published in Hugo R. Ensslin's 1917 Recipes for Mixed Drinks and then repeated, like so many of Ensslin's cocktails, in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book . Both Ensslin and Craddock call for the \"Fifty-Fifty Cocktail\" to be stirred and both also list a Dry Martini cocktail with the addition of \"1 dash orange bitters.\" However, while Ensslin's 2:1 Martini is stirred, Craddock's 1:1 Martini is shaken, so according to Craddock, a Fifty-Fifty should be stirred while an equal parts Dry Martini is shaken. Remember, this is 23 years before Fleming's first Casino Royale Bond novel.",
