  "History": "In Germany this drink is called a ‘Turbojäger’, a ‘Flying Hirsch’ with flying referencing Red Bull’s marketing slogan \"Red Bull gives you wings\" and Hirsch (German for ‘stag’) the Jägermeister logo. In Mexico, it is called a Perla Negra’ (Black Pearl) and in Finland, a ‘Akkuhappo’ (meaning ‘battery acid’). A Jäger-train is a theatrical method of preparing a number of Jägerbombs at once. To do this set up a row of old-fashioned glasses with one extra glass than the number of drinkers at the end. Pour half-a-can of Red Bull into each of the old-old fashioned glasses. Pour Jägermeister into shot glasses and balance on the rims where each of the two old-fashioned glasses meet. Starting one end knock the first shot glass into the old-fashioned glass beneath and the rest should follow domino style.",
