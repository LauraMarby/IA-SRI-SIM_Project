  "Review": "To quote Jamie Oliver, \"the Huckle-my-buff is not a Dodo, but a Phoenix\".",
  "History": "My adaptation of a recipe presented by Jamie Oliver and Jimmy Doherty on Friday 9th August 2013, at the Cabinet Room as their entry to the Difford's Guide Beer-tail Competition for London Cocktail Week 2013. Also known as Huckle-my-butt and Huckle-and-buff, Huckle-my-buff is an early 18th century hot drink combining gin or cognac and beer. Jamie and Jimmy resurrected the Huckle-my-buff and gave it a modern twist with the use of nitrous oxide and a sous-vide in place of the traditional red-hot poker. The Jamie and Jimmy recipe was as follows: whisk 1 fresh egg yolk, then slowly whisk in 20 grams muscovado sugar, 35ml cognac, 150ml Harvey's Stout beer and 0.8ml ginger juice. Pour mixture into a soda syphon, close and charge with nitrous oxide (laughing gas/N2O). Gently warm the filled cream whipper to 60°C in a sous-vide (water bath). Discharge warmed syphon into glass. Finish with freshly grated nutmeg. Originally a punch still drink, Huckle-My-Butt appears in the Ending With \"Party Mixes\" chapter of  W. C. Whitfield's 1941 Here's How Mixed Drinks .",
