(David’s original recipe specifies muddling spoons black peppercorns rather than using 2 pinches black pepper.) Inspiration : “Marshall was inspired by and named after a customer who loves rums, good drinks and travels often because of work, visiting bars for fun. As a supporter of bars and bartenders, he is considered a bar influencer. His passion brings people together. Every country, city and bar has his own ‘Marshall’ and many stories come to mind - good, not so good, inspiring or just funny. It is because of the customers that we love bartending and we keep pushing ourselves to create new and interesting drinks.”",
