  "Review": "“The basic idea for the Hazy Shade was to compose a sweet and sour balanced drink, based on BACARDÍ Carta Blanca and Martini Rosato, that interprets the DNA of a Daiquiri and adds the spicy flavours of the vermouth. To perfect this combination, I infused the BACARDÍ with a cinnamon stick for 24 hours. A little fresh lime, apple juice and vanilla sugar rounds it up and the pink pepper on top gives the drink a great after-taste.”",
