  "Review": "Jones' original 1977 recipe, which consists: 2oz/60ml bourbon, 1oz/30ml lemon juice and 2 spoons sugar, topped with champagne, is built in the glass. This makes for a very powerful drink. Hence, we hope Jones would approve of our tweaking his recipe and shaking to mix. The result still has some oomph, but with the extra dilution of shaking, is a tad more harmonious.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe in Stanley M. Jones' 1977 book Jones Complete Barguide . More information on the history and variants of the French 75 can be found on our page.",
