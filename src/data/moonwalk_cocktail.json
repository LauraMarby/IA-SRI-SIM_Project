Speaking to Difford's Guide in January 2012 Joe said, \"The moon landings were a big deal to everyone at the time and I thought I've got to make a cocktail for this.\" Joe, who watched the moon landings repeated on TV when his shift was over, went on to say, \"I never got to serve Neil Armstrong personally, but I sent one in a flask to NASA and apparently, it was the first drink he had when he landed. He wrote a letter to me at the Savoy to say thank you.\" That letter is on display on the wall of the 'museum' to the left as you enter The American Bar.",
