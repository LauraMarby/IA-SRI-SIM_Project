  "Review": "\"This cocktail symbolizes the highs, lows and successes that everybody, including myself, the Bacardi Company and other companies, will experience or have already experienced in their lifetime. Bittersweet Victory's ingredients mirror this idea: the lows that come with life are reflected through the bitter liquor and lime juice; the highs, on the other hand, can be tasted through the sweetness of the maple syrup. The successes that life brings with it are represented by Bacardí, as the company has surpassed many hurdles in its history to enjoy numerous achievements and personal victories.\" We say : Very slightly on the tart side of balanced with rich maple syrup set against bitter aperitivo and lime juice. Rum notes are subdued but have a presence.",
