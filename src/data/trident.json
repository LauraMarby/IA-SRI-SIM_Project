  "Review": "Bone dry and boozy, this cocktail is aimed at those who have a penchant for both sherry and aquavit, not to mention bittersweet artichoke liqueurs - hardly mass market then. Nor are Aston Martin cars but I want one. Be warned - use the wrong sherry and this drink falls apart - don't be tempted to sub manzanilla with a fino.",
  "History": "Robert Hess created this riff on a Negroni in 2002. The Trident name apparently was inspired by the fact that each of the three main ingredients comes from a different seafaring country.",
