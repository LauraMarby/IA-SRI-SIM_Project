  "Review": "Turkish and Arabic coffee is made with lightly roasted coffee beans that are very finely ground and boiled in water, usually with a little sugar, in a special pot called cezve in Turkey or ibrik elsewhere. It is sometimes flavoured with some cardamom and this vodka-based coffee cocktail harnesses the aromatic eucalyptus and citrus notes of this spice.",
