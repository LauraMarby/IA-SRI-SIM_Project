  "Name": "General Harrison's Nogg",
  "Glass": "Old-fashioned glass",
  "Ingredients": [
    "45 ml Calvados / apple brandy / straight applejack",
    "60 ml Dry cider",
    "15 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°Brix)",
    "2 dash Pimento bitters",
    "1 fresh Egg (white & yolk)"
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    "BEWARE, shaking with fizzy ingredients such as cider tends to be explosive. Hence, use a still/less fizzy cider and hold both ends of your shaker firmly. (If you have to hand, use a specially designed 'fizz' shaker such as Perlini, which is designed to be carbonated).\r\n\r\nSHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into glass (without ice). Be sure to shake well to completely emulsify the egg."
  ],
  "Review": "A whole raw egg contributes body to this filling, flavoursome, wintry, delicate cocktail. The retained CO2 fizz of the cider adds essential body and balancing acidity but demands the use of a specialised shaker.",
  "History": "We were sent this recipe by Dale DeGroff in December 2012 who said: \"A personal favourite, adapted from a recipe from Jerry Thomas' 1862 How to Mix Drinks : a totally different take on eggnog – made as a single-serve drink it includes a raw egg, so you need to shake the hell out of it.\" This cocktail is named after General William Henry Harrison, the American president to hold office for the shortest period. He was elected 4th March 1841 and died a month to the day later of pneumonia. Harrison was known for his drinking and cider was one of his preferred tipples. It is said that this eggnog was his favourite drink.",
