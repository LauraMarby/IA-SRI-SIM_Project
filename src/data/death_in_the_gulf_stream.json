  "Review": "Remembering that Hemingway was a diabetic so had a very sour tooth, we believe this drink needs more than 'one teaspoon' of sugar. Thus we've added half a shot of sugar syrup to the original recipe. It also benefits from dilution, so be sure to shake well and churn in the glass.",
  "History": "According to Charles H. Baker's 1946 The Gentleman's Companion , this libation was a favourite of Ernest Hemingway.",
