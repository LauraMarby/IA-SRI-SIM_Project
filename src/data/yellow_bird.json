  "Review": "With its sunny colour and tropical fruity flavour and rum base, the Yellow Bird certainly evokes the Caribbean. Two rums and three fruit juices, but the ripe banana and peppermint freshness of the two liqueurs that most influence this lightly Tiki cocktail.",
  "History": "Perhaps simply named due to its golden yellow colour or possibly after the 19th-century Haitian tune Choucoune , rewritten with English lyrics as Yellow Bird in the mid-1950s. The song was first recorded with his calypso-style arrangement by Norman Luboff and his choir in 1957. A 1959 recording by the Mills Brothers became a minor hit but it was Hawaiian singer Arthur Lyman's recording that rose to No.4 on the Billboard charts in July 1961. Some say that this record was regularly played at Shell Bar in The Hawaii Village so inspiring the creation of this cocktail there.",
