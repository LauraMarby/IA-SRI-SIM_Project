  "Review": "Orange undertones add citrus depth to the lemon explosion.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created by Dick Bradsell at Fred's bar in London, England, in the late 1980s. His original recipe (1½ shots citrus vodka, ¼ shot triple sec, 1 shot lemon juice, ¼ shot sugar syrup and 3 dashes orange bitters) was served short and straight-up with sugar syrup rather than grenadine. I added the grenadine and made the Leninade a long drink in July 2013 due to comments from Discerning Drinkers saying the name was suggestive of a long red vodka-based drink.",
