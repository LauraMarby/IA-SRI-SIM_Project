  "Review": "Judge Jr's original 1927 recipe calls for \"2 jiggers Gordon water; 1 part lemon juice; a spoonful of powdered sugar; cracked ice. Fill up the rest of a tall glass with champagne!\" I've loosely interpreted this recipe to the one above (with the 3 spoons of powdered sugar being flat 5ml measuring spoons). The result is dangerously quaffable gin spiked champagne with a zesty lemon bite. The powered sugar adds an attractive sherbet note, but if you prefer to use sugar syrup then substitute with Â½oz/15ml (2:1).",
