  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Martin Bornemann at WERK 8, Basel, Switzerland. Inspiration : “A memento not only represents looking back, but also to have something to idolize. This idol could be a musician, or the Cantineros who brought us the legendary cocktails such as the Daiquirí and the Mojito, or it could be the Bacardí family who rose up twice and led us into the new ‘Golden Age of Cocktails.’ My cocktail brings back the iconic Bacardí Banana Daiquirí with a new twist, in a modern, fruity yet dry and well-balanced way.”",
