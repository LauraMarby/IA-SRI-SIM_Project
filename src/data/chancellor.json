  "Review": "Complex and sophisticated, scotch whisky-based with rich and dry vinous notes. Classically, the Chancelor is made with dry vermouth, but even with a rich ruby port, this tends to produce a cocktail that's too dry. I favour a more complex tawny port, and previously, I added 2.5ml of sugar to balance it. Now, instead of sugar, I split the vermouth between dry and bianco vermouths. I also like the above recipe but with the vermouth split three ways: 5ml (1 barspoon) each of dry vermouth, bianco vermouth and rosso vermouth. Others use only rosso vermouth instead of dry vermouth, which adds much-needed sweetness as well as body and colour. Some also use aromatic bitters, but I like to honour the style of bitters specified by Stanley M. Jones in his 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide .",
  "History": "The Chancellor cocktail most likely originated in London and is named in the \"Supplementary List\" of cocktails that \"space forbids giving the recipes\" in William James \"Billy\" Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Bar Book . The Chancellor also appears in Stanley M. Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide .",
