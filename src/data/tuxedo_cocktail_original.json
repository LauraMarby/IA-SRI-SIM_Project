  "Review": "I've tried this recipe with 2 to 3 dashes of Angostura and also orange bitters, but I prefer it with 2 dashes of both aromatic (Angostura) and orange bitters, so honouring Johnson, MacElhone, Mahoney and Grohusko. The result is a very aromatic semi-Dry Martini.",
  "History": "Based on the earliest Tuxedo recipe I'm aware of in Harry Johnson's Bartenders Manual (1900 and later editions). The same recipe, bar the odd dash of bitters, also appears in Jack's Bar Manual by Jacob Abraham Grohusko (1910), Hoffman House Bartender's Guide by Charles Mahoney (1912) and Barflies & Cocktails by Harry MacElhone (1927). All four of the revered bartenders stipulate equal parts old tom (sweet) gin and French (dry) vermouth with one dash each of maraschino and absinthe, but Grohusko's recipe adds 3 dashes Angostura Bitters; while MacElhone, Mahoney & Johnson call for orange bitters in place of the Angostura.
