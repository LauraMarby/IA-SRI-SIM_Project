  "Review": "Sweden's answer to the Irish Coffee .",
  "History": "Created in 1987 by Bosse Bergström, a Swedish bartender for a coffee drink competition held in Stockholm. Following the competition, his drink became popular across Sweden and beyond. In the late 1990s, I remember the packaging for Galliano bottles sold in my London shop including a Hot Shot glass and spoon to aid layering of the ingredients. At parties in Sweden, it was commonplace for guests to chant \"hot shot, hot shot, hot shot!\" The Hot Shot has proven enduring in Sweden, so much so that it has its own 'national day', celebrated on the third Friday of November.",
