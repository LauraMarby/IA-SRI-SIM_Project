  "Review": "One of the simplest and best mixed drinks ever devised, hence its lasting popularity. To serve as a Highball use a smaller 10oz (295ml) Highball glass (in place of a 12oz (355ml) Collins glass) and fill with 45ml (1.5oz) gin and 90ml (3oz) tonic water along with plenty of ice.",
  "History": "The precise origin of the G&T is lost in the mists of time. Gin (or at least a grain-based juniper spirit) was drunk for medicinal reasons from the 1600s onwards. Quinine, the pungent bark extract which gives tonic its distinctive bitterness, had been used against malaria for even longer. The first known quinine-based tonics were marketed during the 1850s. The popularity of tonic in the British colonies, especially India, is clear with Schweppes launching their first carbonated quinine tonic in 1870, branding it Indian Tonic Water. The ladies and gentlemen of the Raj also drank phenomenal quantities of gin. It is therefore accepted that gin and tonic emerged in India during the second half of the nineteenth century and was drunk partly to ward off malaria.",
