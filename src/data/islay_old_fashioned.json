  "Review": "Given its name, obviously, this cocktail was originally based on Islay peated malt whisky, but as they'd say on the BBC, \"other peated whiskies are available\". Choose judiciously, and this Old Fashioned will be delicious.",
  "History": "In late 2014, Eliot Cole sent me an email saying, \" one of my favourite drinks ever was an Old Fashioned made with Laphroaig (possibly quarter cask)... it was made at Hotel Delmano in Williamsburg, Brooklyn \". Thanks to Eliot I took to the bar and, with a nod to David Embury 's preference for Peychaud's bitters with whisk(e)y in my mind, made this tasty Old Fashioned. See: Old-Fashioned cocktail history",
