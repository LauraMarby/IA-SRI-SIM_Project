  "Review": "A rye whiskey-based New York Sour without egg white. This Sour has the good looks and also the flavour profile to back them up.",
  "History": "The Brunswick Sour is simply a Whiskey Sour with a float of red wine, an embellishment that is thought to have first been added to a Whisky Sour by a bartender in Chicago in the late 1800s and is now better known as a New York Sour. The Brunswick Sour appears in the 1935 Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book , in which A. S. Crockett notes under the recipe, \"Invented at the Old Hotel Brunswick, once a resort for Fashion, and situated on the north side of Madison Square.\" The hotel is said to have been \"particularly popular with visitors from England as well as wealthy young men about town\" closed in 1896. A detailed history of the Sours family of cocktails is available on our Sours cocktails page.",
