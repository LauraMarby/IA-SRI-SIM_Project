  "Review": "Gin and dry apricot. On the 4th of September 2022, I reduced the volume of my previous recipe by 25% and while doing so I omitted sugar syrup from the recipe to be more in keeping with classic versions of this cocktail which call for lemon juice. (I prefer lime.) My previous recipe: 60ml (2oz) gin, 30 (1oz) apricot brandy, 22.5ml (¾oz) dry vermouth, 7.5ml (¼oz) lime juice, 5ml (1 spoon) sugar syrup.",
