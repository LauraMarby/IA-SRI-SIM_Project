  "Review": "A Margarita without orange liqueur (e.g. a Tommy's Margarita ) is not a \"margarita\" at all but a tequila sour. The triple sec orange liqueur is one of the things that define the margarita (which sits within the Daisy cocktail family ). The Tequila Sour may lack the ring of a Margarita, but it is a very tasty cocktail nonetheless.",
