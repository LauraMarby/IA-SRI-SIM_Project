  "Review": "“The cocktail I made for Legacy is inspired by the Cuban revolution in the late 1800s. I created a very simple drink that could be made in any bar in the world. You can change some of the bases without losing the integrity of the cocktail. I'm focusing on simplicity, whilst maintaining a full flavor.”",
