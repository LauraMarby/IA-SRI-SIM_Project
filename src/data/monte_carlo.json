  "Review": "When served straight-up, the Monte Carlo fits into the Scaffa family of cocktails, but it's much better and more usually served on-the-rocks, so best described as being a Manhattan with Bénédictine in place of vermouth. My hero, the tax lawyer and cocktail writer, David Embury , says in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , \" This drink is a bit on the sweet side. It can be improved by adding 2 parts lemon juice and increasing the rye from 2 parts to about 4 or 5 .\" Embury had a dry palate approaching that of Hemingway's, and most palates will appreciate the extra touch of sweetness in this cocktail, which is best enjoyed as an after-dinner tipple or nightcap.",
  "History": "The Monte Carlo first appears in print in David Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks as \" 1 part Bénédictine, 2 parts Rye, 1 or 2 dashes Angostura to each drink. Shake with cracked ice \".",
