  "Review": "You'll find plum wine and Yukari powder (which tastes like salty, sweet, fruity black tea leaves and looks a little like black tea) at any specialist Japanese retailer (such as London's Japan Centre). We tried making this drink a few times, with homemade pomegranate syrup as well as commercially available grenadine. How generous the spoon of yukari also greatly affected the outcome. Some of the versions we made were great but the recipe is not fool proof, or the ingredients so easily available outside of Japan.",
