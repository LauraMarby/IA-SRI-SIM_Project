  "Review": "I've added the merest touch of sugar to the classic recipe and a dash more absinthe to make this old-school cocktail pop. However, approach with caution, unlike the experiments of Serge Voronoff, nothing about this drink is designed to enhance virility.",
  "History": "Created in the late 1920s by Harry MacElhone at his Harry's New York Bar in Paris , France. The Monkey Gland takes its name from the work of Dr Serge Voronoff who, convinced that testosterone was vital to a long and healthy life, transplanted monkey testicles onto elderly Frenchmen. The \"Monkey's Gland Cocktail\" first appears in MacElhone's 1922 Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails (which, sadly, I don't have access to). In his 1923 edition, he specifies the recipe as \" 1 dash Absinthe, 1 teaspoonful of Grenadine, ½ Orange Juice, ½ Gordon Gin. Shake well, and strain into a cocktail glass. (Invented by the Author and deriving its name from Voronoff's experiments in rejuvenation.) .\"",
