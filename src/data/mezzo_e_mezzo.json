  "Review": "Slightly on the bitter side of bittersweet, this classic aperitivo is light and palate cleansing. Best made with equal parts Nardini Rosso, Nardini Rabarbaro and soda.",
  "History": "Originally and properly made with equal parts Nardini Rosso, Nardini Rabarbaro and soda water, this drink originates from the famous Grapperia Nardini on the Ponte Vecchio where Nardini Rosso was first served with soda water in the 1920s. In the 1970s a drinker tried Nardini Rosso with a dash of Nardini’s rhubarb liqueur. The combination became increasingly popular, and as its popularity grew, so the dash became larger until the mixture reached equal parts Nardini Rosso and Rabarbaro.",
