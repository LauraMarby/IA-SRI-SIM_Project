  "Review": "“‘Santiago Moment’ is a tribute to Santiago de Cuba - the city where Don Facundo Bacardí Massó founded the first worldwide Bacardi distillery in 1862. It also honours the fact that Facundo’s wife Amalia came from a family of coffee farmers. Following the earthquake of 1852 that destroyed the first distillery, it was money derived from coffee, from Amalia’s family, that was used to invest in Facundo’s idea to create a light bodied white rum. “The golden coffee bean and unique flavour of the ‘Santiago Moment’ pays homage to this special moment in BACARDÍ’s history.”",
