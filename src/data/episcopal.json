  "History": "A well-established drink promoted by the marketeers at Chartreuse and named due to the combining of the clerical colours of green and golden yellow. According to The Ecclesiastical Review , the shade of green used for vestments signifies the \"sight of sunlit meadow and shady woodland, all of which indicates the sense of hope and peace or of tranquil gladness.\" Green is worn on Sundays and Ferias in Ordinary Time while golden cloth was traditionally worn for the Novena (16 to 24 December) according to a Spanish custom abolished in the 1950s.",
