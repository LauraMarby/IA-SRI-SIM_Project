  "Review": "Creating this cocktail started with a desire to make a properly British cocktail to toast those special occasions when a fellow Brit wins a sporting event. Fittingly different whiskies in the drink represent England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. London dry gin, British ale and Drambuie are all obviously British, and with names such as Cox, Granny Smith and Kingston Black, apples are intrinsically a Great British fruit, as indeed is the strawberry (think of Wimbledon), so the obvious garnish. Handily, Drambuie contains Scotch whisky so naturally mixes well with the other whiskies, and apple juice is a favourite fruit among bartenders to use in whiskey cocktails. The name is inspired by the Union Jack and also what I thought when I'd successfully combined all the above into one tasty cocktail.",
