  "Review": "Make this winter warmer to the classic 'Burnley' 50:50 proportions and it can be a tad rich, hence the 1:2 proportions used here.",
  "History": "Burnley Miner's Club in North West England is, somewhat bizarrely, thought to be the world's biggest single account for sales of Bénédictine. Its 700-odd members consume around 48 bottles each week. This conspicuous liqueur consumption dates back to after the First World War when men of the 11th battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment, which survived the Somme, were billeted in Normandy. They discovered the local liqueur, Bénédictine D.O.M., which they drank as a grog with hot water. This became known as a 'Benny and Hot' and its popularity travelled home with the troops to Lancashire towns such as Accrington and Burnley. At Burnley Miner's Club the Benny & Hot is served 50/50 Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur and hot water with a squeeze of lemon juice.",
