  "Review": "\"In order to understand where the association with family union around the BACARDÍ brand came from, I spoke to Enrique Comas, a direct descendant of Don Facundo Bacardi. In our conversations he told me deeply moving stories about his family, describing how after earthquakes and a cholera epidemic, Don Facundo lost two of his children. He also lost his first company, and it was thanks to the love of his wife, the help of her family and a lot of determination that they managed to rebuild and make a fresh start. \"The same spirit guides my choices, not only for the cocktail but also for my everyday life. Protecting my own is more important than anything. 'A Part of Me' is born from this love and this strength, combined with my passion for the wonderful craft of bartending.\"",
