  "History": "Greg Lindgren is credited with creating the basil-infused riff on the classic Gimlet in 2006 at Rye in San Francisco, but this recipe is adapted from the Basil Gimlet we discovered the same year at Stella in Boston, USA. This recipe combines fresh lime and lime cordial (part of a Gimlet's DNA) while Greg's used fresh lime juice and simple syrup.",
