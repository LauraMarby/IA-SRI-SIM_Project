  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in 2014 by Andrea Buttier, an Italian bartender from Bologna working at The Loft in Clapham Common, London. Andrea originally used Laphroaig 10-year-old for his malt with equal parts calvados, 2 shots apple juice, 2/3rd shot vanilla syrup and 1 dash Peychaud's Bitters.",
