  "Review": "A sickly sweet blackcurrant and berry fruit flavoured drink for the undiscerning.",
  "History": "So named as this cocktail's flavour resembles Vimto, a brand of fruit juice-based soft drink. The Cheeky Vimto cocktail emerged in Britain in the early Noughties but became famous in June 2005 when the Daily Mail newspaper reported it as being Welsh singer-songwriter, Charlotte Church's favourite drink. She was then something of a teen diva party animal so the paper used the catchy headline, \"Wild Charlotte's binge-drinking shame\". Despite the name, the soft drink Vimto is not an ingredient in this drink, but for the record, it is a sweet purple-coloured soft drink containing grape, raspberry and blackcurrant juices and flavoured with herbs and spices. Vimto cordial was created in 1908 in Timperley, Cheshire, England by John Noel Nichols, a wholesaler of spices and medicines.",
