  "Review": "Readers of Embury will know he had a bone dry palate and Martinis made to his specification are just that, and with the correct dilution, fabulous.",
  "History": "In his The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury writes of this drink \"After extensive experimentation I have arrived at the ratio of 5 to 1 as the proportion most pleasing to the average palate. Personally, I like a ratio of about 7 to 1 even better, and I know some who prefer a ratio as high as 10 to 1.\" Also see our Dry Martini page.",
