  "Review": "Assam tea adds delicate tannins and a touch of smoke to this honey gin sour.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2018 by Jared Brown , who wrote the following about the origins of this cocktail. \"One night upstairs at Balthazar, London, I was hosting a large group and thought I had nearly lost my voice. Before they arrived, I set up a pot of Assam tea, with honey and lemon and asked the bartender to shake this ove ice, strain it into a chilled cocktail glass and serve it to me whenever my glass ran empty. I thought this would soothe my throat and keep me out of trouble - until the third one arrived and it dawned on me how much better the drink would be with a measure of gin. Thus, the Bee's Tease was born.",
