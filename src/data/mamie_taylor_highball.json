  "Review": "Faintly smoky malty Scotch and subtly sweet ginger are flavours that are simply made for each other. Simple but delicious.",
  "History": "Bartenders apparently became so sick of making Mamie Taylors in the 1900s that they hiked up the price of the cocktail to discourage customers from ordering it. Mamie Taylor was invented in 1899 in Rochester, New York, and it spread like wildfire. The name is a bit of a mystery, but there are several versions of a tale linking this cocktail to the Broadway star of the same name. Thirty years after its creation, the Mamie Taylor appears in Albert Stevens Crockett's 1935 The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book with the juice of half a lime served in a Collins glass. Sadly, the cocktail never managed to recover from Prohibition and has since faded from the limelight.",
