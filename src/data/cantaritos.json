  "Review": "Juicy (freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit and lime) and refreshing slightly salty tequila invigorated with sparkling grapefruit soda. Wetting the porous clay exterior of the Cantaritos pot not only improves its appearance but as the water evaporates from the outside so it helps keep the contents cold.",
  "History": "Commonly made in bars, cafés and even roadside stalls of Jalisco, Mexico. The simple Cantaritos clay pot is often used as a disposable take away container.",
