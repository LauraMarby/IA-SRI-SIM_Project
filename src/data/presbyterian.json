  "Review": "Basically a Scotch and soda with a delicate hint of ginger spice, the Presbyterian cocktail should be made using Scotch whisky rather than bourbon, rye, Irish whiskey etc..",
  "History": "A traditional British style of Highball using blended Scotch whisky. The name Presbyterian may come from presbýteros (πρεσβύτερος), the Greek word for 'elder', which incidentally is used 72 times in the New Testament, but the modern Presbyterian Church after which this cocktail is named, originated primarily in Scotland. Indeed, Presbyterian Church government is enacted in the 1707 Acts of Union which created the kingdom of Great Britain.",
