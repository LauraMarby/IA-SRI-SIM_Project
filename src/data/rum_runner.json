  "History": "The Holiday Isle Tiki Bar in Islamorada, Florida Keys, USA, claims to be the \" home of the Run Runner. \" Originally named The Hapi Hula Hut, the bar opened in 1969 and was renamed in 1971. As the Holiday Isle's own website says, \" Legend has it [so evidence is perhaps sketchy] over 40 years ago the Tiki Bar manager John Elber (Tiki John) had to get rid of an excess of rum and other liqueurs before the arrival of new inventory. Tiki John was challenged to concoct a cocktail that would help use the surplus inventory. So he mixed banana liquor, Meyers rum, brandy and grenadine and named it the Rum Runner \" after the liquor smugglers who used the Florida Keys as their base in the early 1900s.",
