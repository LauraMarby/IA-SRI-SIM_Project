  "History": "Created in 2013 by Matthew Coates (M.C.) at Jake's Bar and Still Room, Leeds, England. Matthew was one of five finalists in the Difford's Guide Beer-tail Competition for London Cocktail Week 2013 held on Friday 9th August 2013 at Simon Difford's Cabinet Room in London. Matthew told us, \"The inspiration behind my cocktail comes from my love of all of its components – rum, beer (Guinness) and coffee. I call my drink 'a stout fellow' because it's strong and hearty but also warming and 'friendly'. It also refers to the old Guinness advertising of 'Guinness for strength' encompassing more than one meaning of the word stout.\"",
