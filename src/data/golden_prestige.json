  "Review": "“Inspired by the Original Daiquiri, I wanted to create a cocktail that retained the roots of BACARDÍ Carta Blanca. A touch of history and a dash of nobility combined with an oriental touch. The idea is to keep the exoticism of the liquid that Don Facundo bottled 150 years ago and just add a hint of originality.”",
