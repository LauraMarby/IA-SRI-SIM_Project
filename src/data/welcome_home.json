  "Review": "\"The history of Bacardí, simplicity and my guests were what inspired me to create Welcome Home. The Bacardi family survived a fire, prohibition, earthquakes and exile, and yet the brand is growing every year. The brand began in Cuba, and recent changes open the door to a 'welcome home.' The historical 'El Coco' is represented as coconut syrup; a hint of beetroot juice adds a little peatiness. Don Facundo Bacardi began with a simple shop; I have created a simple drink for my guests, which they could also make at home.\" We say : A beetroot daiquiri with a hint of toasted coconut.",
