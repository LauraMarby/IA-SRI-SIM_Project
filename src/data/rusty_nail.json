  "Review": "The liqueur smooths and wonderfully combines with Scotch whisky. The proportions of Scotch to Drambuie vary wildly and are a matter of taste. However, somewhere around 3:1 appears to be preferred by most.",
  "History": "Said to have been created in 1942 at a Hawaiian bar for the artist Theodore Anderson but popularised during the 1950s at New York City's Club 21. David Wondrich has traced the mixing of scotch whisky with Drambuie liqueur back to 1937 and a drink called B.I.F. for the British Industry Fair. However,  given that Drambuie originated in an Edinburgh cellar in 1908 we suspect the combo was first tried decades earlier.",
