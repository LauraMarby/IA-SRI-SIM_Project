  "Review": "The sweet herbal punch you'll recognise from the classic Vieux Carré but given extra life and fresh vitality by the addition of a shot of tequila (I've halved the usual doses of cognac and bourbon  to make way for the tequila). Plaza Antigua is Spanish for Old Square , while Vieux Carré is in turn French for Old Square hence I first tried using añejo tequila as the sole base spirit, but while good, this drink strayed too far away from what's recognisable as a Vieux Carré.",
