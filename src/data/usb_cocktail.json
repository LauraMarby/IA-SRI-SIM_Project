  "History": "A brandy-driven riff on the Palermo cocktail created in 2003 by yours truly in London, England. Named, not after the Universal Serial Bus used to connect PCs and peripheral devices, but after the grape varieties Ugni and Sauvignon Blanc. Ugni Blanc is the most common grape variety in Cognac, while Sauvignon Blanc wine seems to suit this drink, (although it also works well with Chardonnay and other grape varieties).",
