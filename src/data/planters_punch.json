  "Review": "A tangy punch that harnesses the strength and rich flavours of the rum.",
  "History": "Invented in the late 19th century by the founder of Myers's rum, Fred L. Myers. The recipe on the back of each bottle of his rum is known as the \"Old Plantation formula\" and uses the classic rum punch proportions: 1 sour (lime), 2 sweet (sugar), 3 strong (rum), and 4 weak (water). Rather than this, or the American formula:  1 sour, 2 sweet, 3 weak, and 4 strong, I've followed David A. Embury's recommendation (in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks ) of 1 sweet, 2 sour, 3 strong and 4 weak.",
