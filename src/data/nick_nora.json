  "Review": "A classic Three-to-One Dry Martini served in bijou proportions.",
  "History": "Created in circa 1934 and named after Nick and Nora Charles, the flirtatious married couple at the centre of Dashiell Hammett's 1933 The Thin Man story serialised in Redbook Magazine . Published as Prohibition was ending, Nick is a hard-drinking retired detective and his wife Nora a wealthy heiress, both embrace cocktail culture. The Thin Man was published as a novel in 1934 and then a series of movies. In the novel, Nick and Nora shake their Martinis and Nick tells a bartender, \" The important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time, a Bronx to two-step time, a Dry Martini you always shake to waltz time. \" Hence, some insist a Nick and Nora Martini should be shaken rather than stirred. In the movie, the detective duo drink from what has become known as a Nick & Nora glass so this has become the default for this scaled-down to fit Dry Martini.",
