  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Hideyuki Saito at BRONX Liquid Parlor, Bangkok, Thailand. Inspiration : \"La Blanca is inspired by a life changing moment as a child, when I first arrived at a province of Japan called Kumamoto. I had grown up in one of the busiest cities of Japan and the countryside was a brand new experience. I remember tasting a tomato for the first time. It was so delicious, it opened my curiosity for food and flavours. Those experiences changed my life and became a part of the reason why I am a bartender today. 'La Blanca,' the Spanish word for 'white', represents the cleanness and freshness of new experiences.\"",
