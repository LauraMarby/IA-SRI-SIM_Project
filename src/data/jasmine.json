  "Review": "A slightly sour bittersweet riff on the Pegu Club. The original is just on the tart side of balanced without our addition of the optional spoon of sugar syrup.",
  "History": "Created in the mid-1990s by Paul Harrington at Townhouse Bar & Grill in Emeryville, California and named after his college friend, Matt Jasmin, who challenged Paul to \"Make me something you've never made before.\" Inspired by the classic Pegu Club , this cocktail is the result of that challenge. The Jasmine was promoted by its inclusion in his 1998 book Cocktail: The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century .",
