  "Review": "It's a bit of a faff to make, but it's worth the clogged sink drain from the raspberry shrapnel. Using raspberry syrup and especially raspberry jam in a Clover Club introduces cooked \"jammy\" notes, while this can be delicious (see Julie Reiner's Clover Club ), I like to retain and hero fresh berry flavours.",
