  "History": "Created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Anton Martaplias at BarDuck, Minsk, Belarus. Inspiration : “This year Bacardi Legacy was held in Belarus for the third time and I have participated each year. Twice I didn’t get to the top three, but I didn’t stop for a moment working towards my dream. Each day I got closer, with the support of my good friend Ilia; he gave me the ‘simple punch’ to action and now – bam – here I am at the Global Final!”",
