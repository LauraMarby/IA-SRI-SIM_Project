  "Review": "This 'Lady' is high maintenance but she delivers a complex reward.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in 2008 by Ben Carlotto at The Voodoo Rooms, Edinburgh, Scotland. The original recipe calls for homemade dry orange syrup made by macerating orange zests in a blend of different sugars with Lillet Blanc and fino sherry. It also calls for homemade citrus bitters, a complex mixture of kaffir lime leaves, various citrus elements, and spices like cardamom and cassia.",
