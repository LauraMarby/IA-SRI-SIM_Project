  "Review": "Basically, a bitter orange and clove daiquiri. We found this recipe really sung when we added a splash of water for some extra dilution and half a bar spoon of sugar - perhaps our No Peel Orange Marmalade from Wilkin & Sons was a tad on the sour side - or even our limes. Anyway, once balance adjusted this particular \"Breakfast\" was very tasty.",
