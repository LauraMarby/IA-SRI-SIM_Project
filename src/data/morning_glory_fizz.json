    "SHAKE first 6 ingredients with ice and strain back into shaker. DRY SHAKE (without ice) and slowly pour 2/3rds of the contents of the shaker from a higher than normal height into a chilled empty glass (no ice in glass) while simultaneously pouring soda with your other hand. The cocktail and soda should form a single stream of liquid falling into the glass.\r\n\r\nAs when pouring a Guinness, to achieve a perfect head on a fizz, the cocktail should be left to settle for at least a minute before topping off with what remains in the shaker. Ideally, during the settling period, the glass should be placed in a glass froster/fridge/freezer. As the final contents of the shaker are poured into the glass so the head should rise like a souffle."
