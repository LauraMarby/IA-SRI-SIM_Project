  "History": "Created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Sandro Pimenta at Farol Hotel, Cascais, Portugal. Inspiration : \"The name Flight 1862 has a very special meaning because it represents firstly the 'flight' of Don Facundo Bacardí when he left Spain at the age of fifteen and travelled to Cuba, and also the year of the foundation of the Bacardi company, responsible for so many of the classic cocktails.\"",
