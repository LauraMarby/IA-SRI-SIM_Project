  "Review": "Whether enjoyed with breakfast or as an evening aperitivo, this is a superbly cleansing and refreshing cocktail. Our previous recipe called for 50ml vodka, 15ml maraschino and 50ml grapefruit juice. I like maraschino, but, as many pointed out, it's not traditionally an ingredient in this vintage cocktail.",
