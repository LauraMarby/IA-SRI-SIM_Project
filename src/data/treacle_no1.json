  "Review": "Molasses flavours feature in this Rum Old Fashioned.",
  "History": "This twist on the Old-Fashioned was created by Dick Bradsell in 1990s London. Rather than use a stirring glass, Dick made this cocktail directly in the glass the cocktail's served in, adding ingredients and cubes of ice one-after-another, stirring between editions. The apple juice Dick used is the cheap clear stuff rather than the 'posh' pressed cloudy apple juice. In this cocktail, cheap is best.",
