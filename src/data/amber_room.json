  "Review": "Serious and packed with bold flavours. Fellow Chartreuse fans will approve.",
  "History": "This vintage cocktail originated from a layered or 'pousse-café' style drink called a Bijou. The original drink was so named after the French word meaning 'jewel' due to its trio of ingredients being coloured after the three most precious jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and emerald (Green Chartreuse). Stir rather than layer and the colours combine to make this an aptly named amber coloured drink.",
