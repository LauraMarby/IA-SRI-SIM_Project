  "Review": "Perfectly balanced sweet and sour apricot with faint red wine notes.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in 2015 by Stuart Bale of 69 Colebrooke Row, London during a visit to Thuir in the South of France where Byrrh has been made since the 1870s. When Stuart asked what Thuir was famous for, apart from Byrrh, the locals claimed their apricots were the best in the world. Hence Stuart’s use of Byrrh and crème d’apricot in this cocktail.",
