  "Review": "The judicious dashing of bitters makes or breaks this Gimlet -like cocktail which tastes good when made with a dry gin but better when made with an old tom gin, as per the original 1922 recipe. (If your old tom gin is sweet, reduce the sugar syrup.)",
  "History": "The Bennett Cocktail was first published in Robert Vermeire's 1922 Cocktails: How to Mix Them and then repeated in the 1930 book Cocktails by \"Jimmy\" Late of Ciro's London written by the mysterious Jimmy. Both recipes are based on old tom gin and without the addition of sugar. Most modern versions of the Bennett, including that made in 2015 by Meaghan Dorman at The Bennett in New York City, USA call for dry gin rather than old tom.",
