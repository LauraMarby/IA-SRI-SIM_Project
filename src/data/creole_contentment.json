  "Review": "If using a sweeter Madeira such as Verdelho/Rainwater (medium dry) or Bual (medium sweet) you'll need to adjust this finely balanced cocktail. Even Baker himself says it \"needs a little trimming\". However, dry Sercial Madeira works best to produce a finely balanced complex cocktail.",
