  "Review": "A well-balanced chocolatey, minty and subtly coconut daiquiri. Perhaps a tad too many flavours in one drink for some.",
  "History": "Created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Ingrid Skaue Øines at To Rom og Kjøkken, Trondheim, Norway. Ingrid explains the inspiration behind this cocktail: \"When I was a little girl growing up in the artic part of Norway, my dream was always to entertain people around me, to be on stage and make people feel good. Today, the bar is my stage. It is the place where I can be all I want to be, entertain, have fun and share stories with my guests. \"The ingredients in 'Cuban Pete' are inspired by the bold Latin- American flavors. The Bacardí Carta Blanca rum is the perfect base to this cocktail, with fresh floral and citrus notes, sweet crème de cacao, combined with coconut water, fresh mint and lime. When you taste 'Cuban Pete' you can feel him shaking his maracas on your pallet. 'Cuban Pete' is about inviting people to have fun and embrace what is in front of them, just like the Bacardí family did for the American people under prohibition.\"",
