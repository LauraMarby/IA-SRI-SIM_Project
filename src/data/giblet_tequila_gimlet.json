  "Review": "This tequila riff on the usually gin-based Gimlet harnesses the earthiness of the tequila to add an extra dimension which more than compensates for the lack of gin's botanical complexity. As for the name, I originally used mezcal de pechuga as the second ingredient. ('Giblets' is a culinary term for the edible offal of a fowl (heart etc) and pechuga mezcals are distilled with a chicken or turkey breast in the still. 'Pechuga' is Spanish for poultry breast.)",
