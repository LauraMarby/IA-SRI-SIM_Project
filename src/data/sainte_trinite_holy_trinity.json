  "Review": "Cognac, elderflower liqueur and Chartreuse (a trinity indeed) with dashes of bitters and an aromatic citrus twist. This is a boozy cocktail so you may prefer our 25% smaller riff to suit a Nick & Nora rather than the original Coupe glass: 45ml / 1½oz Cognac 15ml / ½oz Elderflower liqueur 10ml / 1/3oz Yellow Chartreuse 1 dash Orange bitters",
