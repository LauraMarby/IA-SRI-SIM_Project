  "Review": "When, as originally, this cocktail is made with Rutte Celery Gin , then celery notes are very obvious in the final cocktail - perhaps more so than in the gin itself. Whatever gin you favour, this contemporary version of the 20th Century is fabulously expressive of the gin with subtle rich chocolate notes.",
