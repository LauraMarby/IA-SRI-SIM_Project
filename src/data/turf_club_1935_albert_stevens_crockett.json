  "Review": "Albert Stevens Crockett's original recipe calls for two-thirds genever to one-third sweet vermouth, but this produces an overly dry cocktail so I've upped the proportion of vermouth to genever. Made with a quality oude genever, this cocktail is almost nutty and makes for an interesting aperitif.",
