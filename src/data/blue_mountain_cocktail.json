  "Review": "Traditionally this cocktail does not include blue curaçao with its name referencing Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee and not the colour. Mysteriously, our photo of this cocktail has a distinct blue hue so this led me to adapt the recipe to fit both the image and its name. My original recipe: 1½ shots Bacardi Carta Ocho aged rum ½ shot Ketel One Vodka ½ shot Coffee liqueur 1½ shots Freshly squeezed orange juice",
