  "Review": "Reminiscent of an Espresso Martini but with raisiny fruit and distinctive gentiane bitterness. A great after dinner sipper but don't let that stop you enjoying this complex cocktail as an aperitif.",

Add a pinch of sea salt and slowly cook for 10 minutes, then chill. \" Kenny say's, \" Through my research into the Bacardí family I discovered that the world-renowned inventor Don Facundo Bacardí and passionate bartenders around the world all have something in common: the curiosity to create something epic and to achieve their own legacy.  My drink is inspired by my past Bacardí Legacy compositions and driven by my never-ending curiosity for bartending. \"",
