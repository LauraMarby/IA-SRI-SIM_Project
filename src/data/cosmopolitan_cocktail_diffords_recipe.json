  "Review": "The Cosmopolitan was originally made with citrus vodka, but it's great with unflavoured vodka or a combination of the two vodkas - my preference. For this recipe, as long as your combined vodka totals 37.5ml (1¼oz) or a splash more, you should end up with a tasty, balanced cocktail. I've previously added orange bitters, but the combination of triple sec liqueur and the bitter oil from the garnish is orangy enough. Like so many cocktails, two or three drops of saline solution help meld all harmoniously.",
  "History": "The origins of the Cosmo seem to originate in the gay bars of 1970s San Francisco, but this contemporary classic cocktail was perfected and popularised in 1990s New York City. Along the way, several bartenders played their part in its success, but perhaps TV's Sex and the City was the most influential. For the full story, see Cosmopolitan cocktail history .",
