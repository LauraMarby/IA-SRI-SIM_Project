  "Review": "A foam-topped blue riff on two classic cocktails which honours two men named Cox as well as our friend Hannah Sharman-Cox .",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in 2013 at the Rum Kitchen, Notting Hill, London. The name 'Cox' is a common theme to this drink: 1. It is inspired by the Perfect Lady , a classic cocktail created in 1936 by Sidney Cox, a bartender at the Grosvenor House, London for The British Empire Cocktail Competition where it took the 1st Prize. 2. The original Daiquiri, said to be created in 1898 by Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer working at a tin mine near the Cuban town of Daiquiri. 3. Most importantly, this drink was created and named to honour the fabulous Hannah Sharman-Cox of London Cocktail Week fame.",
