  "Review": "Sweet fruitiness masks the alcohol in this easy-drinking, long cocktail. \"Sex\" is associated with red (e.g.red light district) and is represented in this drink in the form of vodka, cranberry juice, and black raspberry liqueur. These 'sexy' ingredients sit atop the sandy yellow \"beach\"– consisting of peach schnapps, orange juice, and pineapple juice.",
