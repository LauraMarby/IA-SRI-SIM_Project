  "Review": "This carpet scary, appropriately named, blood red cocktail balances the rich fruitiness of port with the fortifying complexity of cognac. A popular drink in classic British pubs.",
  "History": "After the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) when the British Royal Navy demonstrated its navy supremacy by conquering the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies the Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships without a single British vessel being lost. However, the English lost Admiral Lord Nelson who was mortally wounded during the battle aboard HMS Victory. To preserve Nelson's body during the return voyage to England, the ship's surgeon ordered that his body be placed in a barrel of French brandy. Although this was lashed to the deck and guarded, stories abound of sailors drinking the brandy out of respect for their commander, Nelson.",
