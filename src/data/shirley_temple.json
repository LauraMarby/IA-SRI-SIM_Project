  "History": "Named after the 1930s child film star, Shirley Temple who retired from acting in 1950 at the tender age of 22 having already starred in an incredible 42 films. She appeared in her first film when just three-years-old in 1931 and two years later she achieved international fame after appearing in Bright Eyes , a feature film designed specifically to capitalise on her obvious talents. Cocktail legend has it that Shirley complained of being overlooked at Hollywood parties where the adults surrounding her sipped on sophisticated cocktails leading to a bartender at Chasen's Restaurant in Beverly Hills (the venue for many Academy Awards parties) to create the eponymous non-alcoholic cocktail in her honour. After her second marriage, Shirley Temple Black, became best-known as a diplomat and the US ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia.",
