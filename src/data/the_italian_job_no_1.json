  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2001 by Tony Conigliaro at Isola in Knightsbridge, London, England. The original recipe calls for 22.5ml of the now-defunct Monasterium liqueur so I've replaced with Chartreuse (50/50ish Green & Yellow), which I suspect was the inspiration for Monasterium.",
