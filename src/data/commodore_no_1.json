  "Review": "A Daiquiri sweetened with raspberry and grenadine syrup and mellowed by egg white.",
  "History": "The first of two Commodore cocktails in Albert S. Crockett's 1931 Old Waldorf Bar Days . (See Crockett's Commodore No.2 recipe). David A. Embury also includes a Commodore cocktail in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , where he writes, \" Another version of the Commodore calls for whisky instead of rum, omits the egg white, and uses orange bitters in place of the grenadine. Obviously, the two Commodores command two different fleets. \" Embury is perhaps referring to the \"Commodore Cocktail\" recipe in Harry McElhone's 1922 Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails or in Harry Craddock 's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book , both whisk(e)y based.",
