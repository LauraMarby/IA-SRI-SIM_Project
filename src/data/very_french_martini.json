  "Review": "Cognac, pineapple juice and black raspberry liqueur. OK, so France is not known for its pineapples but I said 'very' not 'totally' French. And yes I know it's not really a Martini.",
  "History": "A riff on the French Martini created in January 2015 by yours truly and Matthias Lataille at the Cabinet Room, London, England. I subsequently found I'd created an almost identical drink, the French Cocktail back in 2011. However, I prefer the Very French Martini name - even though it's far from being a Martini.",
