  "Review": "Traditionally a Daiquiri should always be based on light rum but if I should feel like breaking with tradition and using aged rum, I find Embury's 8:2:1 formula works particularly well with a sweet aged rum. However, with drier aged rums, depending on the sourness of the limes, I up the sugar from 7.5ml (representing 1 part from the 8:2:1 formula) towards 10ml (as in the recipe above). So, depending on your rum and limes, 12:3:2 may be better than 8:2:1.",
  "History": "According to David A. Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , the classic proportions of a daiquiri are 8 parts (2 shots) white label Cuban rum, 2 parts (1/2 shot) lime juice and 1 part (1/4 shot) sugar syrup. See: Daiquiri cocktail history",
