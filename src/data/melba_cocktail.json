  "Review": "This would be better named, \"Melba Daiquiri\", as it is a Swedish punsch, absinthe, and grenadine influenced Daiquiri. I've dramatically changed the equal parts rum and Swedish punsch specified in The Savoy Cocktail Book original, and upped the grenadine, but hopefully for the better.",
