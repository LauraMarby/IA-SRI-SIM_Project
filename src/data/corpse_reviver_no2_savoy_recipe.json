  "Review": "Well-balanced, with zesty lemon and absinthe just shining through. I've added the merest dash of sugar, but depending on your personal tastes, citrus juice and triple sec, you may want to omit this.",
  "History": "As the name alludes, The Corpse Reviver is one of a category of 'pick-me-up' cocktails 'prescribed' by bar keeps of old to revive those souls that appeared in their bar feeling worse the wear from overindulgence the night before. Perhaps more a 'kill or cure' than 'a hangover cure', pick-me-up cocktails emerged in the mid-1800s. One of the earliest references to the Corpse Reviver appears in the 21st December 1861 edition of the English weekly satirical magazine Punch, or The London Charivari as one of a trio of such libations, \" after liquoring up a Sling, a Stone Wall, and a Corpse-Reviver .\" The first known Corpse Reviver recipe appears in the 1871 The Gentleman's Table Guide , which calls for equal parts brandy and maraschino with two dashes Boker's bitters.",
