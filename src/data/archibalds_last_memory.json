  "Review": "This drink is so spirituous that it may have finished Archibald off, but at least his last drink was a proper sharpener. Then again, the perceived health-giving herbal benefits of Fernet and Bénédictine combined in such a dosage would have perhaps got him back on his feet. We prefer this cocktail served on-the-rocks as the dilution takes the edge off the spirituous attack and opens the cocktail, releasing more of its delicate herbal complexity.",
