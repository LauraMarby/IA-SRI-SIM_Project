  "History": "Today, the term Red Snapper means a Bloody Mary made with gin instead of vodka. However, the first known recipes, from the 1940s, describe a 50-50 blend of vodka and tomato juice, with spices, just like an early Bloody Mary: one book even states that the Red Snapper is identical to the Bloody Mary.
