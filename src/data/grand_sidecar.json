  "Review": "A riff on the classic Sidecar that's even simpler to make but equally tasty. Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge consists of 51% cognac so there is no need to add cognac to make a great Sidecar, simply add lemon juice. This drink benefits from a touch of dilution so also works well served on-the-rocks in an old-fashioned glass.",
