  "Review": "Reminiscent of a coconut and falernum (clove influenced) daquiri.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Ryan Kent Wainwright at The Ponte / Faith and Flower, Los Angeles, USA. Inspiration : “The inspiration for this drink was floating in the waves off the Puerto Rican beach of Playa Fortuna while drinking a coconut; taking this idea and using a distinctly Puerto Rican spirit, Bacardí rum, and allowing it to shine. “I liken it to the apothecary symbol: the spirit is the staff, with the ingredients winding their way around the frame to highlight its strengths but never detract from this very uniquely Bacardí drink. All of this seeks to highlight honesty: an honest product, an honest time and an honest drink.”",
