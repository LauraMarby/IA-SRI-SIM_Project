  "Review": "Vivid blue with a pale blue head, this is a striking cocktail. It also packs a whopping 45ml (1½oz) of blue curaçao but is far from being a \" disco drink \". It is a balanced colourful and vintage riff on the even older White Lady .",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from W. J. Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Cocktail Book (Coronation Edition) which says this drink was \"Invented by Victor.\" Victor Cabrin is widely credited with creating the White Lady .",
