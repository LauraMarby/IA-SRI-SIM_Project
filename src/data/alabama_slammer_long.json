  "Review": "A Screwdriver that's flavoured and lightly sweetened with a trio of liqueurs.",
  "History": "Said to have been made famous by American former football quarterback Brett Favre. Just eight weeks after a near-fatal car accident resulting in 30 inches (76 cm) of his small intestine being removed, on 8th September 1990, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama. The Alabama coach, Gene Stallings, is quoted as saying, \" You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to. I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life. \" Truth is, the Alabama Slammer was popular in the U.S. a decade before Favre's miracle win and was being served in bars, including T.G.I. Friday's, in the 1980s. There are numerous recipes for this cocktail dating from the late 1980s, some with orange juice and others with grenadine replacing the sloe gin found in better recipes.",
