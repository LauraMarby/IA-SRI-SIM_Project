  "Review": "Basically an Aviation but with triple sec in place of maraschino and lime instead of lemon juice. Gaz used lime juice because he didn't have any lemons but in this adaptation of his recipe I've mellowed the citrus sourness by using a combination of both lime and lemon juice.",
  "History": "This riff on the classic Aviation was created by Gary \"gaz\" Regan and first published in his The Cocktailian column in the San Francisco Chronicle on 27 September 2007. Gaz wrote, \"After making my new baby I took it for a stroll around my deck and gazed up at the moon. It was off-white that evening, but it had a faint purplish hue to it. Just like my drink. The Moonlight Cocktail was born.\" For the story behind the origins of the Aviation and its many other variations see our Aviation cocktail page.",
