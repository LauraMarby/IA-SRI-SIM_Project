  "Review": "Tequila-based, with complex mezcal smokiness, rich maraschino cherry and floral lavender bitters. It's a cocktail that likes dilution so perhaps consider serving on the rocks.",
  "History": "Created in April 2015 by yours truly. The name was inspired by the lyrics of Neil Young's 1969 song, Cow Girl In The Sand , which, depending on who you believe, is about \"unrequited love for a beautiful free-spirited woman,\" or about a promiscuous woman, or about a Spanish beach. I thought the lyrics mentioned \"Sandy the showgirl\" and was surprised to find they don't when I came to expand this explanation behind the name.",
