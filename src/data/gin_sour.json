  "Review": "This 4:2:8 formula is a tad sourer than the classic sour proportions of 3:4:8: three-quarter part of the sour ingredient (lemon juice), one part of the sweet ingredient (sugar syrup) and two parts of the strong ingredient (gin). However, dependent on your lemons, this should be perfectly balanced, or even a tad on the sweet side. Hit the right balance and this is a delicious cocktail.",
