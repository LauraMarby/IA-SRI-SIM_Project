  "Review": "Wayne Collins , this drink's creator, originally used equal parts as is usual for a classic Negroni and after trying various other formulations, I've found this works best. Wayne also specified a grapefruit zest twist and this makes the cocktail. However, be warned, this is a cocktail for aficionados of bittersweet aperitifs and gentian.",

Later, Simon Ford , who was the Plymouth Gin ambassador, introduced the drink to Audrey Saunders in the early days of her Pegu Club where the drink became a hit on the menu.",
