  "Review": "A trio of base spirits blend harmoniously in a cocktail of which Trader Vic himself said, \" You know that adios means good-bye. You drink two or three of these, and it's adios, believe me, it's adios. \" His original recipe calls for \"light Puerto Rican rum\" and I originally interpreted that as a charcoal-filtered light white rum. However, I've since found this cocktail works best with a light rum with a little more age and character.",
