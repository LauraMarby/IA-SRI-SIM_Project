  "Review": "As with all Martinis, striking a perfect level of dilution and achieving an ice-cold serving temperature (helped by chilling/freezing all ingredients, the glass and garnish) is key. However, a Dirty Martini introduces another element, olive brine, and your choice of olives and accompanying brine will make or break this cocktail. (Beware, olives packed in oil produce a revolting emulsion.) Then there's the question of how much olive brine to use. Depending on personal taste and the intensity of flavour of the olive juice, this varies from 5ml to 22.5ml. I've found that my taste is middle of the road at 10ml (⅓oz) to 15ml (½oz), although if it's very mild olive juice, then I'll happily stretch to 20ml (⅔oz).",
  "History": "Cocktail historian David Wondrich has traced the origins of the Dirty Martini back to 1901 and a bartender called John E. O'Connor, who served a Dry Martini with muddled olives at New York's Waldorf Astoria. The first written reference to brine being added to a Martini-style cocktail appears in G.H. Steele's 1930 My New Cocktail Book .",
