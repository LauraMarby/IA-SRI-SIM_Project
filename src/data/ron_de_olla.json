  "Review": "“The ‘Ron de Olla’ cocktail is inspired by the ‘Café de Olla’ of Mexico, which has a flavour characterised by adding cinnamon and piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar). “To give a twist to this very typical beverage, I have used BACARDÍ Superior rum instead of piloncillo, both coming from the cane, and added hot cold chocolate – bringing a sweetness and body to the drink. The orange twist breaks the sweetness and aromatics with a citrus taste, and the BACARDÍ Superior brings out the taste and flavour of the almonds and vanilla – creating a balanced flavour profile.”",
