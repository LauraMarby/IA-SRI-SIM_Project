  "Review": "\"The idea of the 'Soirée Cup' is to combine different international drinking ceremonies and traditions in one drink. In China and Japan it is traditional to sit together for a tea-ceremony. Rum is identified with Caribbean drinking culture and in Europe, including Austria, it is customary to offer a glass of wine. This cocktail celebrates the art of serving fine drinks at an evening party with friends.\"",
