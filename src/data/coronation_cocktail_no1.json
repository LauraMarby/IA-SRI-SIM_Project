  "History": "Created for, or soon after, the Coronation of England's King Edward VII, who became King on 22 January 1901, upon the death of his mother, Queen Victoria. His Coronation was set for 26 June 1902, but just two days before, an emergency operation required for an attack of appendicitis forced the investiture to be postponed until 9 August 1902. The Coronation Cocktail first appears in Charles S. Mahoney's 1905 The Hoffman House Bartender's Guide , where it is credited to Joseph Rose of Murry Bros.' Café in Newark, New Jersey, USA. The date of its creation is not given but the cocktail won second prize in the 1903 Police Gazette Bartenders' Contest.",
