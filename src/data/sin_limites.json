  "History": "Created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Péter Gózon at Warmup RUSTIC bar in Budapest, Hungary. Péter makes his own vanilla syrup by mixing 0.5 kg sugar & 2.5 ml water, simmered with 2 vanilla pods. Peter says, \" When I was a child my father was a journalist so we were always on the move; I lived in many countries and often found when we returned to Hungary that the local children treated me as a foreigner. I used to dream of being an actor, but lost my confidence because of this. \"Three years ago I walked into my first bar and saw the bartenders at work. I was amazed - I wanted to be like them - like actors on a stage – but needed first to overcome my fear. Now, a few years later, I am part of this amazing competition, which has helped me realize that bartending is my life. When I heard my name at the BLGCC semi-final, I felt invincible - I realized that if you do what you really love, then you are Sin Limites. \"",
