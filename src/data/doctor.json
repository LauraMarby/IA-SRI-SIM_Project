  "Review": "Lighter and arguably more satisfying than the various citrus-heavy Doctor Cocktail recipes (see Doctor No. 1 to No. 4). Obviously, with two such dominant ingredients, your choice of rum and Swedish punch will greatly influence the result.",
  "History": "There are earlier Doctor recipes combining Swedish punch and rum (see Doctor No. 1), but this recipe, which first appeared in Frank Meier's 1936 Artistry of Mixing Drinks , has proved the most enduring, helped by its being republished in Victor Bergeron 's 1947 Bartender's Guide... by Trader Vic",
