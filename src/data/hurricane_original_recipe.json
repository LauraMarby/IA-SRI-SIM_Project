  "Review": "The flavour of the syrup predominates.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe in Jeff Berry's 1998 Beachbum Berry's Grog Log , in turn, adapted from the purported original 1956 recipe created to use a surplus of rum by Louis Culligan, head bartender at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans. In place of passion fruit syrup, Culligan's 1956 recipe used Red Passionola syrup, a red-coloured line extension of the amber-coloured brand of syrup. Passionola has a passion fruit-forward tropical fruit flavour with pineapple, guava, and papaya. The Hurrican cocktail is thought to have originated in 1939 at The Hurricane Bar in New York City but was reinvented and made famous at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans .",
