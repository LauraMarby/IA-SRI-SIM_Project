  "Review": "Considering tequila is replacing vodka in this French Martini riff, you'd think that when it came to tequila, a blanco tequila would be best suited. However, having tried this and then reposado tequila, unexpectedly I found myself turning towards and favouring añejo as being best suited to this cocktail's tropical and berry fruitiness.",
