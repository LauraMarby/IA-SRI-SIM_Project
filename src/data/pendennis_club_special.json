  "Review": "Tangy, subtle, sweet, and sour. Depending on your palate and apricot liqueur you may want to add 2.5ml sugar syrup.",
  "History": "Eponymously named after the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky, the first known reference to this cocktail appears as the Pendennis Club Cocktail in the \"Seductive American Cocktails\" appendix in William \"Cocktail Bill\" Boothby 's 1908 The World's Drinks and How to Mix Them book with just three ingredients: gin, apricot brandy, and dry vermouth. By the time it resurfaces in Charles H. Baker Jr.'s 1939 The Gentleman's Companion as \"The  Pendennis Club's Famous Special\" it morphed into a four-ingredient cocktail served over a split fresh kumquat. Modern-day recipes, such as the above, are nearer to Baker's 1939 Pendennis Club Cocktail than Cocktail Bill's 1908 Pendennis Club .",
