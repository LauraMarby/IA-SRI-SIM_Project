  "Review": "Like a bottle of port, please be sure to pass this cocktail to the left, or at least drink using your left hand. You'll be rewarded with a spirituous bready vinous zesty orange flavoured cocktail that suits late-night imbibing. Challenging right-handed drinkers to maintain drinking only using their left hand throughout the night makes for a great drinking game. Next round is on the first person to impulsively use the wrong hand.",
  "History": "Created November 2016 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England and originally served on-the-rocks. Updated to a straight-up serve in September 2019. As for the name, Google \" Pass the Dutchie \" (with a 't') by Musical Youth. Incidentally, a \"dutchie\" is a cast iron cooking pot (Dutch oven) and the song lyrics are, \"Pass the dutchie 'pon de left 'and side...how does it feel when ya got no food?\"",
