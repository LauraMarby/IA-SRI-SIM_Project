  "Review": "Peaty Scotch combines wonderfully with floral, delicate elderflower liqueur.",
  "History": "Created in 2006 by yours truly and named after a fellow whisky fan, Xavier Padovani. At the time I was working on the launch of St-Germain and Xav was brand ambassador for Monkey Shoulder whisky. The original recipe was equal parts, after all I was trying to sell St-Germain at the time. The reduction of liqueur to allow the Scotch to shine through is the work of the folk at Le Lion in Hamburg, Germany where they also use single malt and so have appropriately renamed this a 'Single Padovani'.",
