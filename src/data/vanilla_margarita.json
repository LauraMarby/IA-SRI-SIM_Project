  "Review": "A classic Margarita with a hint of vanilla.",
  "History": "I first drank Vanilla Margaritas in 1998 at London's Café Pacifico and I drank a lot of them. I also drank VDQs (Vanilla Daiquiris) at Teatro on Shaftesbury Avenue - often on the same night. The former (Café Pacifico is an early evening haunt) was made with tequila infused with a vanilla pod while the latter (Teatro was most definitely a place to finish a night) was made with vanilla-infused Havana 3yo rum. And way before that, I drank McDonald's Vanilla shakes and ate vanilla ice-cream. Who doesn't like vanilla? I used to, and sometimes still do, make my Vanilla Margaritas just the same way as my regular Margaritas, only based on vanilla-infused tequila (Café Pacifico-style) but thanks to a comment by Vincent Dufour on this very page, (on 5th December 2020) I developed this recipe (that's even better when also made with vanilla-infused tequila).",
