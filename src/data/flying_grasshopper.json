  "Review": "Why drink a mere Grasshopper when you could be enjoying a Flying Grasshopper? This creamy after-dinner cocktail is all the better for the splash of vodka, indeed it's arguably better with a splash more vodka. Minty fresh with indulgent chocolate - reminiscent of a choc mint ice-cream.",
  "History": "A 1970s or earlier more alcoholic riff on the Grasshopper cocktail . Some, including Stan Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Bar Guide omit the cream: 1 vodka, ¾ green crème de menthe and ¾ white creme de cacao to make a clear emerald green cocktail.",
