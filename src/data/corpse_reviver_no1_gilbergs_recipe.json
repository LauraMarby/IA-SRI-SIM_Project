  "History": "In his book The Joy of Mixology , Gary Regan recommends a version of the Corpse Reviver with 2 oz applejack, ¾ oz cognac and ¾ oz sweet vermouth, which he writes was created in 2001 by Steve Gilberg, publisher of happyhours.com. This may make a cocktail strong enough to awaken the dead, but those wishing to remain compos mentis may prefer this equal parts version I created after being inspired by Steve Gilberg's Corpse Reviver.",
