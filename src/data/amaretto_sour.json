  "Review": "Sweet 'n' sour - frothy with an almond buzz. An extra couple of dashes of bitters help balance the drink and add an extra burst of flavour. When made with freshly squeezed lemon juice this can be a great cocktail.",
  "History": "Notably absent from 1970s encyclopaedia-style books listing pretty much all known cocktails of the day, including the comprehensive Stanley M. Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide , the Amaretto Sour is a cocktail of the 1980s , when it starts to appear in books such as Mark Torre's 1987 The Bartender's Cherry . (It may well also be in the 1984 first edition but sadly I don't own a copy.)",
