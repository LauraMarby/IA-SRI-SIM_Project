  "Review": "Vodka laced with sour lemon juice balancing rich almond syrup to make a candy-like cocktail.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created by Mario Da Como at The Renaissance Bar, Badrutt's Palace Hotel, St. Moritz, Switzerland where he worked as head bartender from December 1963 to April 2008 (44 years 5 months). The original version of this drink, the San Moritzino Cocktail was first made by Mario in 1972 when Andrea Badrutt, the hotel's Director, received a \"noble rum\" from South Africa as a gift. Unable to sell it due to the embargo in place at the time, Mario mixed the rum with Cointreau, fresh lime and orzata (orgeat syrup) to create the first version of what would become the hotel's signature cocktail. As vodka became fashionable so the rum based San Moritzino morphed into the St. Moritzino which remains the hotel's signature cocktail to this day.",
