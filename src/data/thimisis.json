  "Review": "\"As senses are the best way to recall a memory, I wanted to create a cocktail that can please our senses and help us remember the place where the Bacardi family began their journey: the Mediterranean. Thimisis clearly has a Mediterranean character and its name is both the Greek word for memory and the first letters of thyme. The reason thyme is so important is that in Ancient Greece it was a symbol of durability and resistance, two things that completely represent the Bacardi family.\" We say : It took us a while to find our bottle of  Bigallet Thyme liqueur but once we tried this drink we discovered it was worth searching out. This is basically a thyme and lavender daiquiri and it likes plenty of dilution. We found a floral honey worked best.",
