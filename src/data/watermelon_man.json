He started serving this cocktail at his weekly roving club nights and this led to its being served in practically every bar in Berlin for years after. When asked by how he had come up with the cocktail , Cookie replied: \"Because when it's late, people who drink beer become boring. They need something stronger and sweeter, like love itself!\"",
