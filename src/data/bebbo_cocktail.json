  "Review": "This vintage riff on a Bee's Knees is fresh, clean and citrusy with rich honeyed notes. I've previously maintained this cocktail is better made using blood orange juice. However, trying it made with both types of orange juice alongside each other, the blood version is different rather than better. (If using honey rather than honey syrup, stir two spoons of honey with the lemon juice in the base of the shaker to dissolve the honey. Then add the other two ingredients and shake.)",
