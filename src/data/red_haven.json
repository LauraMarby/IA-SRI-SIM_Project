  "Review": "Ruby port contributes rich wine notes to this Scotch whisky-based cocktail, with rhubarb amaro contributing complex bittersweet flavours. The Sun Tavern's original spec calls for \"oak bitters\", but given its \"Red\" moniker, I opted for Peychaud's Bitters.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created by Tommy Cummins and discovered in January 2017 at The Sun Tavern, Bethnal Green, London, England, which called for Nardini Rabarbaro Amaro instead of Cynar.",
