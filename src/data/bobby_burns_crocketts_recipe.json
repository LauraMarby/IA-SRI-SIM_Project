  "History": "Recipe adapted from Albert Stevens Crockett's 1931 Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Days where the cocktail is listed as \"Robert Burns\" accompanied by the following notation, \" It may have been named after the celebrated Scotsman. Chances are, however, that it was christened in honour of a cigar salesman, who 'bought' in the Old Bar [at the Waldorf-Astoria]. \" Robert Burns was a brand of cigars and the name of a cigar shop close to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It could be that the hotel sold these cigars, and the shop's owner was such a good patron of the bar that a cocktail was named in his honour. See Bobby Burns cocktail history for the whole story.",
