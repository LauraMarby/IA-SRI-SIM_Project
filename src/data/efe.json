  "Review": "This drink tastes better than our rating might suggest but takes into account the palaver and time involved in making a cola reduction to the decree specified as well and having to find or make a “Maple liquor” rather than simply using maple syrup and bourbon.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Osman Fethi Baycan at Alexandra Cocktail Bar, Istanbul, Turkey. (Osman’s recipe actually called for 5ml of Bacardí 8 Años rum but in the spirit of Legacy this is a difficult to convert into ounces so we rounded up to 60ml.) Inspiration : “My inspiration for Efe was the Bacardí Cuba Libre and its history which, is similar to my country’s history. “In Turkish culture, efe means hero, after the adopted name of the men and women who volunteered in the Turkish Independence War. The members of this group helped to change the course of history and were awarded The Medallion of Independence when the Republic was declared. We are saving souls every night behind the bar -  we are the efe of the night! “Efe is dedicated to Facundo Bacardi and to all great leaders who fought and won against the odds.”",
