  "Review": "With its delicate shade of pink from a splash of raspberry liqueur, this cocktail is feistier than it appears with salty gherkin flavours combining brilliantly with celery gin.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2016 by Keli Rivers at Whitechapel Bar, San Francisco, USA. Keli presented this very tasty cocktail at a seminar on gin and genever at Tales of the Cocktail in July 2016, which is where we were lucky enough to first try it. Originally made with Rutte Celery Gin, the flavour of this gin contributes greatly to that of the finished cocktail.",
