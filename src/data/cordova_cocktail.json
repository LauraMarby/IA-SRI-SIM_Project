  "Review": "One of the worst cocktails in Harry Cradock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book . If you follow Craddock's recipe then this cocktail is more appropriately named the 'Curdled Cream Sweet Martini'. Reducing the gin and upping the cream (as per the recipe above) helps prevent curdling and produces a more palatable, if still not great, cocktail.",
