  "Review": "Sorrelade looks a little like cranberry juice and like cranberry juice has a bittersweet, slightly spicy taste.",
  "History": "Jamaican sorrel is made from the red sepals of the Roselle plant, also known by its scientific name Hibiscus Sabdariffa . While this variety of Hibiscus grows wild in Jamaica, such is the demand for sorrel that it is widely propagated. (Jamaican sorrel is not related to the English Garden herb of the same name.)",
