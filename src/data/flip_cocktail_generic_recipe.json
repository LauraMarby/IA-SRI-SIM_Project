  "Review": "Made with a full-bodied and flavoursome base spirit or fortified wine, this is a tasty cocktail. Those perhaps put off by a whole raw egg per drink should give flips a chance. (Health concerns relating to raw eggs taken into account of course.)",
  "History": "Flips basically consist of any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole egg and sweetened with sugar. They are typically garnished with a dusting of nutmeg and served in a sour glass or small coupe. They can be served hot or cold. Flips, emerged in the early 1600s and Charles Dickens includes this popular drink of the day in his 1861 novel Great Expectations . Early flips consisted of a tankard of ale to which a mixture made from sugar, eggs and spices was added before being heated with a red-hot iron poker from the fire. Later they came to mean any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole egg and sweetened with sugar.",
