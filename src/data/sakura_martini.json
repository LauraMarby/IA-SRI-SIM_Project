  "Review": "This Reverse Martini -style cocktail originally featured a floating salted cherry blossom as a garnish. This is not just for looks; the hint of saltiness it lends to this delicate drink replaces the savoury note that an olive typically brings to a Martini.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2015 by Kenta Goto. This is the house Martini at his Bar Goto in New York City, USA where it is garnished with a salted cherry blossom (rather than including saline solution in the recipe). See: Martini cocktail and its evolution",
