  "Review": "In Poland, Bison Grass vodka and apple juice are a classic combo, here also with an additional splash of Polish honey liqueur. Adjust the quantity of apple juice and honey liqueur to suit your palate. We've played around with this recipe a lot over the years (it's one of our favs) and for us, equal parts (preferably with freshly pressed green apple juice) is perfectly balanced.",
  "History": "Created by Dick Bradsell , for his (Polish) father-in-law, Victor Sarge. Dick's original formula was equal parts and he specified sweet clear pasteurised apple juice in preference to cloudy fresh juice.",
