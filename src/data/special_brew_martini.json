  "Review": "Hopefully, it's 'Special'! 'Brew' refers to both the use of Byrrh (pronounced beer) and sake (which is brewed). To be a true 'Martini' a cocktail should have both gin and vermouth – we tried gin but vodka worked so much better. Byrrh doesn't qualify as a vermouth as while an aromatised wine it lacks wormwood – an omission made up for in this drink with a dash of absinthe.",
