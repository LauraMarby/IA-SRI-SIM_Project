  "Review": "The addition of orange juice and an orange zest twist supposedly gives this otherwise classic Sidecar a feminine twist. Classically, this cocktail does not contain sugar syrup, so it is a touch sourer. Hence, if you have a dry palate, omit the sugar, and if you have a sweet palate, consider increasing the sugar syrup to 5ml (1/6oz).",
