  "Review": "Stirred down and boozy – very boozy, especially when made with bonded rye and applejack (as per the original recipe) rather than the comparatively subdued calvados used here. However, the cocktail's apple notes, coupled with the subtle herbal complexity of Chartreuse, combine wonderfully in this potent rye whiskey-based after-dinner sipper.",
  "History": "Created in 2007 by Daniel Eun at PDT, New York City, USA. Daniels' original recipe, as recounted in Jim Meehan's 2001 The PDT Cocktail Book , uses Wild Turkey rye whiskey and calls for the drink to be served straight-up in a coupe rather than on-the-rocks. However, we prefer this with the added dilution from serving over ice. In the book, Jim writes, \"This drink looks like the sky during the harvest moon – when reddish-orange moon (the orange twist) rises after sunset.\"",
