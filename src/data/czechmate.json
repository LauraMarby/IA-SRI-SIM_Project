  "Review": "The herbal notes of Becherovka are noted for combining harmoniously with beer, fittingly in this recipe a pilsner (Becherovka is Czech, as are the origins of pilsner). This combo is fortified with vodka and freshened with lemon juice to produce a long refreshing cocktail which makes a great alternative to merely drinking beer.",
