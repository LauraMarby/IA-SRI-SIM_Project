  "Review": "A boozy riff on the Last Word made more interesting by subtle notes of peated Islay whisky.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2016 by Martin Bilsborough, Manchester, England. Martin's original recipe called for the glass to be rinsed with Ardbeg. I tried this but preferred the extra hint of peatiness gained by combining an Islay malt with the rest of the ingredients. Last Word history",
