  "History": "Pronounced 'Mor-Esk', this classic drink is very popular in the South of France, where it is now commonly made with pastis in place of absinthe. It was originally created by French soldiers serving in the Bataillon d'Afrique during the Algerian campaign of the 1830s and 40s, and was alternatively known as Bureau Arabe after the military department which dealt with local affairs and was said to act like 'an iron fist in a velvet glove'.",
