  "Review": "My recipe remains pretty faithful to Craddock's classic 1930s proportions, but in line with modern bartending conventions, I now disregard Craddock's instructions and stir rather than shake this cocktail. However, arguably, shaking yields an even more delicious cocktail, and if you decide to shake, consider doubling the measures of both crème de violette and absinthe. Shaken or stirred, this Martini-style cocktail is dry and aromatic with subtle floral and aniseed notes.",
