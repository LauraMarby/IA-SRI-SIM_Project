  "Review": "The holy trinity of rum, coconut and pineapple served in a well-balanced, not overly sweet Tiki-style cocktail.",
  "History": "The bartender most associated with this cocktail is Oswald \"Slade\" Greenslade, who was born in the Bahamas and worked at the Pink Elephant nightclub. This is where he claims to have created this cocktail in 1963 for three women at his bar who wanted something fruity they'd never had before. Some question Slade's claims, saying the cocktail appeared on menus in the 1940s-50s, although I've not yet seen evidence of such a menu. However, in September 2024, Slade sent us his original recipe and the story of his Bahama Mama.
