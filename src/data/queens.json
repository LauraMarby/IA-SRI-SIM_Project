  "Review": "Gin-based with vermouth's bittersweet wine notes and pineapple tropical fruitiness. This fruity Martini takes its name from a three-equal parts Perfect Martini being called the Queen . This version not only has pineapple but traditionally 1 part dry vermouth and 1 part rosso vermouth to 2 parts gin. I prefer with a tad less dry vermouth.",
