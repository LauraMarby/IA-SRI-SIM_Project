  "Review": "Basically, a Spritzer with a generous splash of Italian red bitter liqueur - dry and very refreshing. The perfect aperitivo. In Venice, this is based on the local white wines of the region: Pinot Grigio, Soave, or Prosecco, but as this cocktail has travelled, prosecco has become dominant. However, I prefer, as I first encountered this cocktail, with Pinot Grigio.",
