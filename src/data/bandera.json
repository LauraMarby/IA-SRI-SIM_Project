  "Review": "In Mexico the quality of the homemade Sangrita can make or break a bar. The Sangrita in this trio is spicy and slightly sweet.",
  "History": "A popular and classic way of serving tequila in Mexico. Bandera is Spanish for the flag, and the Bandera de México is, of course, green, white and red, hence the three glasses: lime juice (green), Blanco tequila (clear or \"white\") and Sangrita (red). The Bandera is also drunk to celebrate Mexican Independence Day with the green lime juice representing the independence movement and the red Sangrita chaser representing the blood of the national heroes. Appropriately, sangrita means 'little blood' in Spanish, and Sangrita is served with tequila in practically every bar in Mexico.",
