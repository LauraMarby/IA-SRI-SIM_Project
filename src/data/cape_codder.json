  "History": "Basically a \"vodka cranberry\" with a splash of lime, the Cape Codder is named after the Cape Cod resort on the Massachusetts coast. This is where some of the first Europeans settled in the US and found cranberries, the indigenous North American berry, the juice of which is mixed with vodka and a splash of lime to make this drink. The same combination of ingredients went by the earlier name \"Red Devil\" this faded soon after the name Cape Codder emerged. The Cape Codder quickly become a popular drink, reaching the height of popularity during the early 1980s. Victor Bergeron includes a similar \"Rangoon Ruby in his 1972 Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide as one of his own creations.",
