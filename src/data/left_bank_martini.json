  "Review": "Aromatic, floral and dry. Modern bartending convention would suggest that this drink should be stirred. However, it's much better shaken. Go easy with the spray of lime zest oils - this delicate cocktail is easily overpowered with more than a fine mist.",
  "History": "Left Bank hints at the use of wine in the recipe as the term usually refers to the region below the Gironde Estuary in Bordeaux encompassing the Médoc with St-Julien and Margaux. However, in this case, the name refers to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, a district on the left bank (south) of the River Seine in Paris. Created in 2006 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room in London for the launch of St-Germain elderflower liqueur, originally using Sauvignon Blanc rather than Chardonnay (but both work well, as indeed does any dry white wine). In 2013, I also reduced the elderflower liqueur from ¾ shot to ½ shot and the vermouth from ½ to a ¼ shot. Martini cocktail and its evolution",
