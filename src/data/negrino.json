  "Review": "A riff on the classic Negroni from Vietnam, which brilliantly set the richness of sloe gin against bone dry fino sherry while harnessing the herbal bitterness of gentian. Hit the right dilution, and by the third sip, when your palate has adjusted, you'll not be able to stop sipping this bitter aperitif cocktail.",
