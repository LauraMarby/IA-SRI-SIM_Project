  "Review": "Essentially, a Jack Rose with a couple of dashes of absinthe. (If making this with bonded-strength applejack in place of calvados, then knock back to 50ml.)",
  "History": "This vintage cocktail first appeared in Charles H. Baker's 1939 The Gentleman's Companion in which Baker says the cocktail is \" from the notebook of one of our pilot friends–when off duty–may seek one. \" His friend obviously was a pilot for Pan Am Airlines. The Pan American Clipper's modern-day popularity is partly due to its being heroed by St. John Frizell at his Fort Defiance bar in Brooklyn, New York City, USA. Our version of this classic by yours truly.",
