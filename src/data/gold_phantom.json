Talking about his inspiration for making this drink, Matthew said, “In 1884, when Henry Royce opened his first workshop in Hulme, Manchester, did he ever dream his firm would one day produce a magnificent Rolls Royce Phantom plated in solid gold? Valued at £5 million, it is considered one of the world's most expensive super-car’. Each ingredient in my drink is, or was, considered a sign of luxury and wealth. The silver dragees I used to garnish my drink represent the bearings of the car.”",
