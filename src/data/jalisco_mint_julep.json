  "Review": "Given the use of tequila, I initially opted for agave syrup over sugar syrup but I found the caramel notes this added somewhat overwhelmed the mint. Instead, perhaps consider using demerara sugar in place of white cane syrup or a mix of the two. To be honest, I found myself preferring the original whiskey-based Mint Julep when tasted against each other but I'd encourage you to give a tequila-based Mint Julep a try, and if you have a better version then please email me at simon@diffordsguide.com.",
  "History": "Created in February 2017 by yours truly (Simon Difford) at the Cabinet Room, London, England. For the contentious history of the Julep along with its variants, see our Julep page .",
