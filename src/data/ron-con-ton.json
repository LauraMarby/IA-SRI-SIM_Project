  "History": "The Finnish Bacardí Legacy 2015 winning cocktail created by Mauricio Allende at Grotesk Bar, Helsinki. Mauricio says, \" The inspiration behind Ron-Con-Ton was to make a contemporary twist on the Mojito, one of the most revered Cuban classics and BACARDÍ Legacy cocktails. My idea was to give it a completely new lift with the addition of fresh basil and tonic, keeping it simple yet different and therefore easily mixable around the world. \"",
