  "Review": "“My cocktail is inspired by the era of alcohol prohibition in the United States from 1919-1933. During this period marketing, agencies created memorable campaigns to attract Americans to visit Cuba, then considered “the unofficial US saloon”. The marketing campaign during this ‘Golden Era’ gave BACARDÍ one of its most famous tag lines “Fly to Cuba and bathe in BACARDÍ”.",
