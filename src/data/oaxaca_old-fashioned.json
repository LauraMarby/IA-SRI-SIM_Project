  "Review": "An agave-based old-fashioned with a wonderful hit of smokiness from the mezcal. Like many cocktails, Philip's original recipe (of 45 ml Reposado tequila, 15 ml Mezcal, 7.5 ml Agave syrup and 1 dash Angostura bitters) has morphed with chocolate bitters now favoured by many in place of Angostura (as per the recipe above). If using a \"sweeter\" style glycerine-based (rather than alcohol-based) chocolate bitters, such as Fee Brothers, or you have a bone-dry palate, then consider reducing the agave syrup to 5ml.",
