  "History": "In his 1922 How To Mix Them Robert Vermeire includes the following recipe for the Mayfair Cocktail and crucially also claims that this cocktail is his own creation. Mayfair Cocktail Fill the shaker half full of broken ice and add: ¼ gill of Dry Gin. ¼ gill of plain Orange Juice. 3 or 4 dashes of Apricot Syrup flavoured with a little Cloves Syrup. Shake well and strain into a cocktail glass. This cocktail possesses a delicious flavour. I invented it at the Embassy Club in London, 1921. Mayfair is the aristocratic quarter of London, called so because during the reign of Charles II (seventeenth century) they used to hold a yearly fair during the months of May. This cocktail also appears in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book : \" Mayfair Cocktail 1 Dash Clove Syrup. ¼ Apricot brandy. ¼ Orange juice. ½ Gin. Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.",
