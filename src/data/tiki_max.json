  "Review": "This drink breaks the golden rule - simple is beautiful. However, it's tasty and packs a punch.",
  "History": "Created in 2008 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England. The inspiration for this drink came not from the similarly named discount clothing retailer but the venerable Tiki cocktail itself. Tiki drinks, otherwise known as 'exotics' originated in 1934 when Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, a Louisiana native who had made some money bootlegging rum during Prohibition, opened a bar called Don's Beachcomber in Hollywood and began serving rum based, fruity cocktails. Soon after, Victor 'Trader Vic' Bergeron transformed his restaurant Hinky Dinks into a similar faux Polynesian style. These founding fathers spawned many Tiki imitators and despite a dip in popularity from the 1970s, happily the noughties saw a revival in the fortunes of Tiki.",
