  "Review": "The success or failure of this tangy drink is partly reliant on the quality of marmalade used.  For ease of use, choose \"fine cut\" or even \"no peel\"/\"shredless\" orange marmalade.",
  "History": "This neo-Martini was created in 1996 by bartender and long-term President of the United Kingdom Bartender's Guild, Salvatore Calabrese . Being of proud Italian descent, Salvatore usually has little more than a swift espresso for breakfast. However, one morning, Sue, his English wife, insisted he sit down for breakfast and served him toast and marmalade. Salvatore came up with the idea for his Breakfast Martini while enjoying the tangy preserve-covered toast and took the jar to work with him. Later that day, at London's Library Bar in the Lanesborough Hotel , he perfected his signature cocktail. Coincidentally, Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book includes a recipe for a \" Marmalade Cocktail \" that's very similar to Salvatore's Breakfast Martini. However, Salvatore says that the inspiration for his drink was the hearty English breakfast and not the classic English bartending book.",
