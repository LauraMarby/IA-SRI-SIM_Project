  "Review": "Kappeler's 1895 recipe calls for the Old Tom gin and orange bitters to be stirred with ice and strained into a glass, with port poured down the side of the glass so it settles to form a red layer beneath the orange bitters tinted gin. I've added a spoon (5ml) of sugar syrup to Kappeler's recipe to slightly sweeten the gin (omit if using a sweet old tom) and a splash of water to add some much-needed dilution. I also prefer to abandon the original layering and stir all the ingredients together.",
