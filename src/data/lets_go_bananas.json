  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Nicolas Munoz at Bespoke Cocktail Bar in Paris, France. The original recipe: 3 slices ripe banana, 60ml Bacardí Carta Blanca rum, 15ml Noilly Prat Original Dry, 20ml lime juice, 7.5ml sugar syrup, and 1 spoon pastis. Nicolas says, \" With this cocktail, I wished to celebrate the return of 'fun' in establishments offering quality cocktails. What better than bananas to symbolize this - served in a coupette, a glass historically associated not only with parties and fun, but also with quality and class. This cocktail wonderfully complements the notes of the Bacardí Carta Blanca rum . Cheers and... let's go bananas! \"",
