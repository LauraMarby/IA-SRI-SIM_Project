  "Review": "Cognac supercharged with vodka, rounded with sherry and invigorated by champagne. Handle with care.",
  "History": "Created in the early 1950s in Las Vegas, USA, then known as the \"Atomic City\" due to its proximity to the Nevada Test Site (NTS), just 65 miles north of the city. Between 1951 and 1992, NTS was America's leading nuclear weapons test site, with mushroom clouds easily seen up to 100 miles away, leading to increased tourism to Las Vegas. Throughout the 1950s into the early 1960s, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce capitalized on the nuclear tests and the spectacle of nuclear clouds and flashes. Casinos hosted \"dawn parties\" and created atomic-themed cocktails, including this one.",
