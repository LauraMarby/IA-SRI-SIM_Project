Born Vera Jayne Palmer in April 1933, Jayne Mansfield's fame and notoriety were helped by her numerous publicity stunts and flamboyant personal life. Nicknamed \"Hollywood's smartest dumb blonde,\" she enjoyed several box-office successes, won a Golden Globe Award, and, in the sex comedy Promises! Promises! (1963) became the first American actress to perform a nude scene in a major movie. Tragically, she died aged just 34 (on 29 June 1967) in a car crash in New Orleans.",
