  "History": "Created in 2015 by Marcus Heale at The Churchill Bar and Terrace, Portman Square, London, England. Marcus explains, “The original Brandy Alexander was created to be served at a dinner in honour of Phoebe Snow; a fictional character all dressed in snow white, used to advertise clean burning coal on steam trains. In 1951 Martell VSOP Medallion cognac hit the headlines when famous explorer Paul-Emile Victor, a great connoisseur of cognac, took eight cases with him on a polar expedition. Then in 1986 Martell Cordon Bleu was featured on the menu of a special Orient Express service from Venice to Copenhagen. I wanted to create a cocktail that reminds one of the polar arctic when sipped, with ingredients to commemorate the Orient Express journey from Venice to Copenhagen.”",
