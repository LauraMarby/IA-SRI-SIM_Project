  "Review": "Fruity and a touch on the sweet side, this is a Screwdriver with added peach schnapps liqueur .",
  "History": "The Fuzzy Navel , a mix of peach schappes and orange juice, was named by an adverting agency in 1984 as part of a campaign to support the US launch of De Kuyper Original Peachtree. \"Fuzzy\" in the name refers to the peach schnapps while \"navel\" refers to the orange variety of the juice. Given the rise of vodka at the time (Absolut launched in 1980), it was only a matter of time before someone added vodka to the mix, upgrading this cocktail from being merely being \"Fluzzy\" to \"Hairy\". The next logical development was to add another popular product at the time, cranberry juice, to make a Pierced Navel cocktail.",
