  "Review": "Your choice of genever will make or break this fabulous cocktail. My recipe is based on a medium-dry, rounded, and complex genever (e.g. Rutte Old Simon or Bokma Oude ) that will contribute an underlying bready note freshened by zesty orange from the orange curaçao. If using a higher maltwine (moutwijn), more old-school genever (e.g. Old Duff ), then equal parts genever and rosso vermouth work well but Philip Duff himself recommends: 30ml (1oz) Oude genever 50ml (1⅔oz) Rosso (sweet) vermouth 5ml (barspoon) Orange curaçao 1 dash Aromatic bitters",
  "History": "Drinks historians broadly agree that the Martinez evolved from the Manhattan and preceded the Martini and that it emerged sometime in the 1860s or early 1870s. The first known recipe for a Martinez in O.H. Byron's 1884 The Modern Bartender would appear to corroborate both the rough time of its birth and its morphing from the Manhattan as Byron tellingly lists the Martinez as a variation of the Manhattan.",
