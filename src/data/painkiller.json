  "Review": "The broadside firepower of navy rum balances sweet pineapple and coconut in what is an all too delicious Tiki-style libation.",
  "History": "From the Soggy Dollar bar on the island of Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. The bar's name is logical, as most of the clientele are sailors and there is no dock. Hence they have to swim ashore, often paying for drinks with wet dollars. A variation on the classic Pina Colada. See our main Piña Colada page for the story behind the classic and for links to numerous other variations.",
