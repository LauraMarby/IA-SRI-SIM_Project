  "Review": "This citrusy aperitivo has an attractive tartness balanced by rich almond syrup.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created by Barney Toy at Revelry Bar in Auckland, this was the New Zealand Bacardí Legacy 2015 winning cocktail . During the competition, Barney said, \" This drink was inspired by the luxury and style on board Pan American Airway's First Class flight that transported travellers from Florida to Havana in the 1920s and 1930s during Prohibition. The sophisticated elegance and fragrance of the Pan Am Cocktail would have been the perfect welcome complement to sip harmoniously while waiting to escape to an extravagant weekend in Havana, Cuba. \"",
