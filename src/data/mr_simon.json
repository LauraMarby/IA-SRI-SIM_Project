  "Review": "Your choice of genever and orange curaçao greatly effects the balance of this cocktail. Salvatore uses Rutte Old Simon which is not only a fantastic genever with an attractive nutty character but also befits the name. The choice of a drier, high alcohol curaçao obviously produces a correspondingly drier drink.",
  "History": "Created in 2015 by Salvatore Calabrese at his bar in London's Playboy Club. Salvatore was inspired to make this drink both by the vintage 'Gin Cocktail' - perhaps the first ever gin cocktail - and Old Simon Rutte genever, which was being released across Europe at the time.",
