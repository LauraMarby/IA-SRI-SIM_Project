  "Review": "A riff on a White Negroni, originally incorporating a generous dosing of two types of rhubarb bitters. (Also works well with 15ml / 1oz Fee Brothers Rhubarb Bitters). Obviously, with such generous used of bitters, this is a dry bitter aperitivo style cocktail.",
  "History": "Created by Todd Crummy, a freelance bartender in Chicago, USA, who says this drink is “Named after Igor Stravinsky's seminal work Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring). Todd's original recipe calls for: 1½ old tom gin, ½ Suze, ½ Cocchi Americano, ¼ Fee Brothers Rhubarb Bitters and ¼ Brooklyn Hemispherical Rhubarb Bitters.",
