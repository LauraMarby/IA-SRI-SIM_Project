  "History": "Colleen Bawn is an anglicization of the Gaelic 'cailín bán', meaning girl or young woman. The Colleen Bawn (or The Brides of Garryowen) is also the title of a melodramatic play written by Irish playwright Dion Boucicault and first performed on 27th March 1860 at Miss Laura Keene's Theatre, New York City. The first recipe for the Colleen Bawn cocktail appears in print in Frederick and Seymour Davies' 1896 book Drinks of All Kinds For All Seasons and is repeated, almost verbatim, in Edward Spencer's 1903 The Flowing Bowl .",
