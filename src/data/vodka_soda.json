  "Review": "Dry and refreshing with a pleasant minerality. The proportion of soda water to vodka in this recipe is 2.5 to 1 (a ratio that appears to have the widest appeal) consisting of one 150 ml can of soda water to 60 ml vodka = 210ml plus ice melt total liquid in glass. If using a 12oz glass (350ml to fill level), the ice displacement = approximately 140ml, so ice forms 40% of the contents of the glass. To raise the percentage of ice to the ideal of around 50%, you should use a 14oz Collins glass or a Spanish-style Copa glass.",
