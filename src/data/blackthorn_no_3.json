  "Review": "As Robert Vermeire says in his 1922 Cocktails: How to Mix Them , \" The Blackthorn is a very old cocktail, which is made in two different ways. \" The most popular way is with various combinations of sloe gin/dry gin and vermouth (see Blackthorn No. 1, 2, 4, 5 and Blackthorn English). This whiskey-based Blackthorn is the oddball in the long-running Blackthorn franchise. Dry and aromatic, it is whiskey's answer to gin's Dry Martini .",
