  "Review": "\"The scents and flavours of my grandparents' backyard are one of the lasting memories of my childhood. It wasn't until much later when I began travelling that I realised that these characteristics are not unique to Cyprus (which was named after copper). Living in Spain taught me the connection between Mediterranean cuisine, the Spanish love for rum, and therefore their link to the Latin world. These three elements, combined with the romanticism of a childhood backyard, created a 'bridge' in my mind between three worlds. So, I present you El Puente, my own legacy.\"",
