  "Review": "The game this drink is named after is French while the main ingredients are Spanish and Italian, but they do play Pétanque in the Basque region of Spain. However, both the creator of this drink and the Creole-style bitters used originate from the USA – perhaps it took a non-European to bring these ingredients - fino sherry and amaretto - harmoniously together.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in 2014 by Andrew Bohrer at Mistral Kitchen, Seattle, USA, and named after the French game where hollow metal balls are thrown as close as possible to a small wooden jack ball. Inspired by playing Petanque in France whilst sipping on pastis, I tried Andrew's original spec but with an additional float of absinthe. To be honest, I tried pastis first but the liquorice notes detracted from the cocktail. A couple of dashes of absinthe merge with the body of the cocktail to add harmonious additional complexity. Hope you agree.",
