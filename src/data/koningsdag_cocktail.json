  "Review": "This very Dutch celebratory cocktail was created using Dutch vodka, Dutch orange curacao, and Dutch-made ginger liqueur. Carrot juice provides the all-important orange hue and subtle flavour. For the truly orange King's Day experience, make it with 50% Ketel One vodka and 50% Ketel One Oranje , or even replace vodka with 100% Ketel One Oranje.",
  "History": "Created by yours truly in April 2015 in celebration of Koningsdag, a festival held in the Netherlands on 27th April each year when the Dutch dress in orange and party to commemorate their monarch's birthday. Any excuse to party!",
