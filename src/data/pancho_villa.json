  "Review": "Dilution is key to this cocktail so either shake with crushed ice (as per the original recipe) or do as I do and add chilled water. Even then, to quote Victor Bergeron, \" This'll tuck you away neatly - and pick you up and throw you right to the floor \".",
  "History": "Named for Francisco Villaruel Guilledo (1901-1925), a Filipino professional boxer known as Pancho Villa. He was only 154cm (5 feet and 1 inch) tall and weighed 51kg (114 pounds) at his heaviest, and was the first Asian to win the World Flyweight Championship in 1923. Never knocked out in his entire career, he is regarded as one of the greatest Flyweight boxers of all time. He died suddenly, aged 23, from complications following a tooth extraction. The Pancho Villa cocktail first appears in Charles H. Baker, Jr. 's 1939 The Gentleman's Companion volume II – An Exotic Drinking Book . Our recipe adapted from Victor Bergeron 's 1947 Bartender's Guide by Trader Vic , a recipe repeated in his 1972 Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide .",
