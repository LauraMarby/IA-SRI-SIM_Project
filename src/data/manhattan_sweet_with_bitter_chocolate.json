  "Review": "Those with a sweet tooth should not be misled by the word \"sweet\" in the name of this drink, which refers to the use of sweet vermouth in what is a dry but not bone-dry spirituous cocktail. Bourbon provides the backbone, maraschino a faint cherry fruitiness, while the all-important chocolate bitters add, well, bitter chocolate notes. Oh, and there's a dash of dark chocolate liqueur for decadence sake.",
