  "Review": "If you don’t have pineapple syrup, or the time to make the pineapple syrup as stipulated in Joseph’s recipe, then don’t worry - this drink also works well when made with 10ml / 1/3oz pineapple juice and 10ml / 1/3oz of sugar syrup (2:1).",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Joseph Harper at Dakota Deluxe, Leeds, UK. Joseph makes his own pineapple syrup with 2 parts sugar, 1 part pineapple juice, 1 part boiling water. Stir water and sugar until dissolved, add juice. Inspiration : “Pilar is named after Ernest Hemingway’s fishing boat, which he used in a fishing competition the Bacardí family invited him to via airmail. This boat was a symbol of his own religious downfall, and so its name suits a drink that marries two classic cocktails: the ‘Missionary’s Downfall’ and the ‘Airmail,’ to bring together the opposing styles of Tiki and opulent drinks.”",
