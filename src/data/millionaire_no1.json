  "Review": "High proof pot still rum funk, along with a decent quality apricot brandy and sloe gin is key to the success of this full-flavoured red cocktail.",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book . Craddock also lists a \"Millionaire Cocktail (No.2)\" as follows: \"1 Dash Anisette The white of 1 Egg 1/3 Absinthe 2/3 Dry gin Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.\" In his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury's says \"At some bars a drink served under the name of \"Millionaire\" which consists of lime juice, slow gin, and apricot brandy, with a few dashes of Jamaica rum. Since the sloe gin, which is a liqueur, predominates in this drink, I do not regard it as a true cocktail.\" Embury is more complimentary of what he calls a \" Millionaire Royal \", proclaiming it to be \"a very satisfactory drink.\"",
