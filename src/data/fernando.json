  "Review": "An unusual, vermouth-based herbal cocktail - very fresh and aromatic.",
  "History": "I came across this cocktail in 2010 at Employees Only in New York City, its birthplace. The recipe I took away from that night called for 30ml (1oz) dry vermouth, 30ml (1oz) rosso/sweet vermouth, 7.5 Galliano, and a mere 5ml (1/6oz) fernet, but I noted: \"Originally based only on bianco vermouth with no dry vermouth.\" I blame their hospitality as it appears their actual recipe for a Fernando is more in keeping with the proportions above. For all those who liked my previous incarnation, the recipe is 30ml (1oz) dry vermouth, 30ml (1oz) sweet/rosso vermouth, 7.5ml (¼oz) Galliano, and 5ml (1/6oz) fernet.",
