  "History": "Bacardí Legacy 2016 winning cocktail created by Chia-An Chan at Angel's Share bar in New York City, USA. Chia-An says, \" I was born into an absolutely alcohol-free family and being a bartender was never my career choice. Yet, life is always full of surprises. Here I stand as a bartender, and I recall that it was the Piña Colada that first introduced me to this sophisticated mixology world. Venceremos is a unique twist on the Original Bacardí Piña Colada, with the added ingredients of two common Asian food pairings: cucumber and sesame oil. It represents both me and my history; where I am from and where my bartending career began. \"",
