  "Review": "Sidecar -like, with a good balance between sweet (triple sec) and sour (lemon juice), fortified by brandy and mellowed by aromatised wine.  Stanley Jones' 1977 recipe calls for equal parts (¾oz a piece), but I prefer a tad more brandy and a scant spoon of sugar. I also added saline and a splash more dilution.",
