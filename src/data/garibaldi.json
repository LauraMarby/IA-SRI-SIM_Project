  "Review": "A fabulous brunch cocktail. How you squeeze (and blend) your oranges is key to achieving the \"fluffy\" orange juice that makes this drink special. At New York City's Dante ( World's Best Bar 2019 ) they famously use a high-speed Breville juicer which aerates the juice. Alternatively, juicing with a pillar or elbow press adds bitter zesty oils from the skin to the juice, hence our use of a smidgen of sugar syrup to balance.",
  "History": "Named after the famous revolutionary general who helped liberate and reunify Italy, the Garibaldi appears on cocktail lists throughout Italy. This little-known classic was brilliantly revitalised by Naren Young for the re-launch of New York City's Dante in October 2015 and remains a must-try cocktail at this World's 50 Best Best Bar .",
