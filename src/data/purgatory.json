  "Review": "Too many, and you're in it.",
  "History": "Created in 2007 by Ted Kilgore at Monarch Restaurant, Maplewood, USA. This recipe is an adaptation from an adapted recipe by Gary Regan and first published in his column in The San Francisco Chronicle . Apparently, Kilgore created this drink as a pick-me-up, but perhaps better suited to being a (put-you-down) late-night nightcap. Comment: Too many and you're in it.",
