  "Review": "\"Visionario is a cocktail that was inspired by the same values that guided Don Facundo Bacardi over 150 years ago: creativity, imagination and determination. These values helped him invent a new style of rum that is still enjoyed today. I dedicate this cocktail to those with passion and a free spirit, who want to make a difference and leave a lasting legacy - just as, I believe, Visionario too can leave a lasting mark and become a classic.\" We say : If you like Negronis then you'll love this drink. Golden rum presents a rounder base than gin to build the layers of bitter and vermouth flavours upon with faint sweet chocolate notes bringing all into a balanced complexity. Perhaps serve on-the-rocks.",
