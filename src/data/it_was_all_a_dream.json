  "Review": "",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Darnell Holguin at Fifty Restaurant and Bar, New York, USA. Inspiration : “My drink is inspired by a traditional Dominican breakfast drink, the Morir Soñando, which literally translated means ‘to die dreaming.’ It consists of orange juice, evaporated milk and condensed milk; my mother would feed my brother and I that every morning with breakfast. She was an immigrant single mother raising two first generation Dominican-American sons in the Bronx. This drink for me symbolizes the hustle for the American dream.”",
