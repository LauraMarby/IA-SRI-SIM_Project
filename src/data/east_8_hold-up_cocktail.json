  "History": "Created in 2010 by Kevin Armstrong at Milk & Honey, London. The name comes from the part of London where Kevin lived, E8, an area where muggings were commonplace. One night Kevin had just dropped Sam Jeveons off during their taxi ride home and Sam stopped to take a leak. While pissing against a wall with his trousers dropped around his feet, a guy came up behind him, stepped on his trousers and told him to hand over his wallet. Sam ended up chasing the guy with trousers around his ankles. The episode became known as the East 8 Hold Up.",
