  "History": "I don't have any notes as to the origin of this version of the Cactus Banger but as one of the older recipes on my database, its origin is pre-late 1990s. A Cactus Banger is perhaps better known as being a simple Harvey Wallbanger based on tequila rather than vodka and it is this version that appears in books such as Stanley M. Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide .",
