  "Review": "A Daiquiri No. 1 with a tang of grapefruit and hint of maraschino. Essentially a Hemingway Special Daiquiri (Papa Doble) Daiquiri for folk without the great author's constitution or love of sourness. (The original recipe is blended and served frappe, rather than on the rocks)",
  "History": "Thought to have been created by Constantino \"Constante\" Ribalaïgua Vert at the El Floridita in Havana, Cuba, circa 1915. He purchased the bar from his employer in 1918 and ran it until he died in 1952. If this was invented as early as 1915, then this was the predecessor of the Hemingway Daiquiri, since Hemingway did not arrive in Cuba until 1928. This is the third of four numbered daiquiris in the 1934 1st edition Bar La Florida Cocktails , menu book, where it is subtitled \"Maidique Style\". According to cocktail historian David Wondrich on spiritsandcocktails.community/ , this is a reference to \" Modesto Maidique was a \"colorful\" Cuban Senator of the late 1920s who liked to challenge those he argued with to rapier duels. In 1931, he shot the former Secretary of the Interior to death in a shoot-on-sight pistol duel. He was released from prison in a general amnesty in 1933. He was certainly the first person any Cuban of the early 1930s would have thought of if they saw the name Maidique. \"",
