  "Review": "Apricot liqueur replaces triple sec in what otherwise follows a broadly classic Margarita recipe. As with my preferred Margarita recipe, my previous recipe was based on reposado tequila with half bar spoon of agave syrup, but a Toreador better suits the clean fresh notes of a blanco tequila with a spoon of sugar syrup. I updated this recipe in January 2025. The Previous recipe: 50ml (1⅔oz) reposado tequila, 25ml (5/6oz) apricot brandy liqueur, 25ml (5/6oz) lime juice, 2.5ml (½ barspoon) agave syrup and 4 drop margarita bitters.",
  "History": "This variation on the Margarita was first published in William J. \"Billy\" Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Bar Book .",
