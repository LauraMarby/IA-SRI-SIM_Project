  "Review": "Basically a bourbon-based Perfect Manhattan with a generous dash of maraschino liqueur. The lack of Amer Picon in this recipe as well as the use of bourbon rather than rye whiskey means it's not what's now generally recognised as being a Brooklyn .",
  "History": "Thought to have originated at the St George Hotel, Brooklyn, New York City, USA. In his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury says of the Brooklyn, \" You will note that the Brooklyn is nothing but a Dry Manhattan with a dash of maraschino. It is supposed to be a specialty of that grand old Brooklyn hotel, the St. George. I would be willing to wager, however, that even in Brooklyn there are at least five to ten times as many Manhattans consumed as there are Brooklyns. Try both and you will understand why. \" Also see: Brooklyn cocktail history",
