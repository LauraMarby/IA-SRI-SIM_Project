  "Review": "Triple sec sweetens dry gin with zesty orange while aromatised wine adds vinous notes. However, it's absinthe that sets this Martini-style cocktail apart. According to bartending convention, this cocktail should be stirred but I much prefer it shaken as when first served this gives the Foghorn a cloudiness that befits its name.",
  "History": "A riff on the Corpse Reviver No. 2 created in the Noughties by Ryan Fitzgerald in San Francisco, USA. Absinthe is said to \"give the drink an opalescence reminiscent of San Francisco's fog\", hence this cocktail's name.",
