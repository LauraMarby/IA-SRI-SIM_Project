  "Review": "Gin-laced, sweet 'n' sour with a fruity blast of rich raspberry toned by dry vermouth. Depending on your raspberry syrup, the finished cocktail may range in colour from a shade of pale yellow to a tinge of pink through to pink red (the cocktail above was photographed made with homemade syrup). You may need to vary the measure of syrup from 12.5ml to as much as 20ml (2/3 oz): this is as much dependent on personal taste as your choice of raspberry syrup.",
  "History": "The Clover Club cocktail is eponymously named after a club founded in 1896 by a group of prominent Philadelphia journalists who met regularly at Philadelphia's Bellevue-Stratford Hotel from when it opened in 1904. Over time, the club's membership expanded to include lawyers, bankers and prominent businessmen. The Clover Club cocktail is ostensibly the same as the Clover Leaf cocktail, and historians trade newly unearthed quotations to argue one predates the other. The earliest recipe for a Clover Leaf (I have found) is in Jacob Abraham Grohusko's 1908 Jack's Manual . This 1908 origin is confirmed by a quote from 8th July 1908 New York Herald , \" A party of Philadelphians introduced a new appetizer at the Plaza last evening called a clover leaf cocktail. \" The Oxford Companion to Spirits And Cocktails references a 1901 recipe by Michael Killackey, head bartender at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, published in the New York Press on 21st June 1901, but neither I nor others have been able to find this. [If you can help this newspaper's name, please let me know.] The Clover Club Cocktail appears in Paul E. Lowe's 1909 book Drinks: how to mix and how to serve but with the lemon juice omitted from the recipe, although this is thought to be a transcription mistake. The cocktail does not feature in Lowe's earlier 1904 Drinks as they are Mixed but a toast from the club does feature in the book.",
