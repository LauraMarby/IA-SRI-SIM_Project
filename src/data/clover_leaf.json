  "Review": "A Clover Club freshened and made more interesting by the addition of fresh mint, and not just as a garnish.",
  "History": "The Clover Leaf is ostensibly the same as the Clover Club, with various similar recipes coexisting since 1909. The commonly accepted difference between these two very similarly named cocktails comes from Harry Craddock 's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book where he states a Clover Leaf Cocktail is \" The same as Clover Club, with a sprig of fresh Mint on top \" and so for most it is merely the decoration that distinguishes the two cocktails apart. However, there's a little more to it than that. The first known recipe for Clover Leaf appears in Jacob Abraham Grohusko's 1908 Jack's Manual , while the first Clover Club is found in Paul E. Lowe's 1909 book Drinks: how to mix and how to serve . [ The Oxford Companion to Spirits And Cocktails references a 1901 Clover Club recipe published in the New York Press on 21st June 1901, but I haven't been able to validate this.]",
