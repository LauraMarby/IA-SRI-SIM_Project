  "Review": "Citrus and the tang of Swedish punch add a distinctive flavour to gin in this tasty vintage cocktail.",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from Albert Stevens Crockett's 1931 The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book where the recipe is accompanied by a notation as to who or what this cocktail is named after, citing \"John Jacob\" or \"William Waldorf\", both members of the Astor family, a wealthy American family whose fortune originated in the fur trade and became centred on New York City real estate investments. John Jacob Astor IV (1864-1912) was the real estate magnate who built New York's Astoria Hotel, \"the world's most luxurious hotel\" and died as the richest passenger when the RMS Titanic sunk. William Waldorf \"Willy\" Astor, 1st Viscount Astor (1848-1919) was John Jacob's cousin and rival who built the original Waldorf Hotel next door to his cousin's hotel. The combined complex became known as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.",
