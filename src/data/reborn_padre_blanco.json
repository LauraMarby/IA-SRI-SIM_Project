  "Review": "\"Reborn Padre Blanco is dedicated to Ernest Hemingway who loved to drink a classic Daiquiri from the El Floridita Bar in Cuba. Reborn is a term referring to any person or anything that has existed already, and this year Padre Blanco - my 'Legacy' drink from last year - is reborn with Bacardí Carta Blanca rum and guava to complement the spirit and to represent the fruit bats which Amalia Bacardi insisted were used as a symbol of good health, wealth and family unity. I used agave nectar as Hemingway was a diabetic, and lime balances the sweetness. Egg white and lager symbolize a celebration, refreshment and a new life.\" We say : For the \"guava & agave nectar pre-mix\" we used 30 ml Rubicon guava and 15 ml agave. The finished drink was very fruity, just a smidgeon on the sweet side of balanced but a splash more beer tamed the fruitiness and brought the drink together.",
