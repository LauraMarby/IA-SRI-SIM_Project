  "Review": "I tried making my usual Sweet Manhattan but with añejo tequila as the base spirit and it was not half bad, but there's something about tequila that says 'white' rather than 'red' vermouth. I also started with my favourite addition to a Sweet Manhattan: a half spoon of syrup from the maraschino cherry jar, but añejo tequila is so much more suited to maraschino liqueur. So I switched sweet vermouth for bianco vermouth and Angostura Bitters for lavender bitters. (I love the combination of tequila and lavender.) Hope you like the result.",
