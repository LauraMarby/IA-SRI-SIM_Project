  "Review": "A genever-based Wet Martini with an orange influence courtesy of triple sec.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2015 by Lee Clarke after he and a few friends visited the Bols Museum in Amsterdam. His recipe, a simple variation on a Vodka Martini with equal parts vodka, dry vermouth and triple sec, became the trip's signature cocktail. Given the Amsterdam connection, we thought it appropriate to try using genever in place of vodka with an added dash of orange bitters. If being in this book, we're not fame enough, in 2023, the Amsterdamage was made on BBC television's Nigella's Amsterdam Christmas Special .",
