  "Review": "With thanks to Bob Cook, a Discerning Drinker, who on 27th October 2020 left a comment with the recipe for this delicious high-proof whiskey, equal parts Manhattan on our Sweet Manhattan page . Many thanks, Bob. Short for High Proof Rye Manhattan, I originally unimaginatively named this cocktail High Rye Manhattan but another (sadly anonymous) Discerning Drinker commented on this page on this page (see comments below) suggesting \"High Ryeser\" was a better name. It is! A truly collaborative cocktail.",
