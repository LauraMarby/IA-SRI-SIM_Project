  "Review": "Cognac stirred with orange and apricot liqueurs along with a dash of orange bitters. The original recipe calls for two dashes but go too heavy with your bitters and this subtle drink will be wrecked. Achieving perfect dilution is also key, hence our adding half a shot chilled water (ice allowing of course).",
