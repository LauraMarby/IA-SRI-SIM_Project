  "Review": "Apple brandy, orange and tart lemon enriched with maple syrup. Strike the perfect balance and this is a delicious combination. This cocktail's name alone suggests making it with American applejack brandy rather than French calvados, and when made with 45ml (1½oz) straight bottled-in-bond 50% alc./vol. applejack in place of the calvados, it's arguably a better cocktail.",
  "History": "The Apple Jack Rabbit appears in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book and in David A. Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks where he tells us \" This drink is also sometimes, for no reason at all, called the Applejack Dynamite. The same cocktail made with a gin base plus a dash of Angostura is called the Old Vermont. \"",
