  "Review": "Gin-laced and Martini-like with subtle mint and orange.",
  "History": "This drink first appears (alongside Tipperary No.1 ) in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book where he stipulates to \" Shake well \" However, in his later, The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury uses little less vermouth and instructs to \" stir with cracked ice \". Shaking seems to amplify the bitter notes in the mint so I prefer to follow Embury's stirring method while leaning more towards Craddock's more generous vermouth proportions.",
