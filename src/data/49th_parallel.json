  "Review": "Sidecar-esque with zesty citrus tartness.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2015 by Robert Wilson at Urban Farmer, Portland, Oregon, USA. Robert's original recipe (below) was served in a coupe glass but this packed almost 3 ounces of liquor so in July 2020 I scaled this back to fit a Nick & Nora glass, plus I added the merest touch of sugar to balance citrus tartness. Hopefully, I've maintained the cocktail's integrity. 1 1⁄2oz Cognac 1⁄2 oz Straight rye whiskey 1⁄2 oz Lemon juice 1⁄2 oz Triple sec 2⁄3 oz Lillet Blanc 3 dash Peychaud's bitters",
