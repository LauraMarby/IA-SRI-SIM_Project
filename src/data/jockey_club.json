  "Review": "Reddy-pink coloured with a sweet and sour, almondy, amaretto-like flavour fortified with gin botanicals.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe which first appears in Harry McElhone's 1922 Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails and established as being the default recipe thanks to its being repeated by Harry Craddock in his influential 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book . However, a \"Jockey Club cocktail\" is first mentioned in the Friday 1st September 1882 edition of The Greenville Journal as being an alternative name for a Manhattan. Quite different and unrelated cocktails named \"Jockey Club\" also appear in Edward Spenser's 1903 The Flowing Bowl (equal parts gin and vermouth with gum syrup, Angostura, and raspberry syrup) and Tim Daly's 1903 Daly's Bartenders Encyclopedia (equal parts Jamaican rum and vermouth with dashes of Kümmel , gum syrup and Angostura bitters).",
