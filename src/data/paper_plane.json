  "Review": "Bittersweet with underlying bourbon character and lemon zestiness.",
  "History": "A riff on the Last Word created in 2007 by Sam Ross for The Violet Hour in Chicago, Illinois. He first made it with Amaro Nonino Quintessentia and Campari but switched Campari out for a less bitter aperitivo liqueur soon after creating the cocktail when he started making it at New York's Milk & Honey . Sam says, \" This cocktail is named after the M.I.A. track that was blasting on repeat the summer we worked on the drink. \"",
