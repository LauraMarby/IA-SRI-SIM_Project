  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2002 by Chris Jepson at Milk & Honey in London, England. Originally made for a Drinks International Magazine competition, this cocktail has gone on to be a much-copied contemporary classic, inspiring riffs such as the Banana Calling . We also discovered a quite different stirred cocktail named London Calling in 2003 at London's Oxo Tower Bar & Brasserie (50ml dry gin, 31.25ml sloe gin, 12.5ml sweet vermouth and 2 dash orange bitters).",
