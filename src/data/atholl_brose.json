  "History": "Legend has it that Atholl Brose was created by the Earl of Atholl in 1475 when he was trying to capture Iain MacDonald, Lord of the Isles and leader of a rebellion against the king. Hearing rumours that MacDonald was drawing his drinking water from a particular well, the Earl ordered it to be filled with honey, whisky and oatmeal. MacDonald lingered at the well, enjoying the concoction, and was captured. Three versions of the Athol Brose appear in Charles H. Baker, Jr. 's 1939 The Gentleman's Companion volume II â€“ An Exotic Drinking Book which he describes as \" an odd Scottish institution, which like many things Scottish, is founded on mighty good reason, & is guaranteed to profit its user. \"",
