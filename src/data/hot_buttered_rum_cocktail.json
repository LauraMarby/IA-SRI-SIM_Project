  "Review": "In his The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury says, \"The Hot Spiced Rum is bad enough, but the lump of butter is the final insult. It blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne!\" It's rare for us to question Embury but we rather like this slightly oily, warming, spicy toddy. This cocktail is even better when you use heated dry cider instead of boiling water.",
