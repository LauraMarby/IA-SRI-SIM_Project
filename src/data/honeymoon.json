  "Review": "This equal parts apple brandy and Bénédictine recipe broadly follows Ensslin's 1916 (the first published) recipe and is not only faithful to the original but the best I've tried. Most contemporary recipes call for: 60ml (2oz) apple brandy 15ml (½oz) Bénédictine 15ml (½oz) Orange curaçao 15ml (½oz) Lemon juice My own previous recipe called for: 45ml (1½oz) apple brandy 22.5ml (¾oz) Bénédictine 7.5ml (¼oz) Orange curaçao 15ml (½oz) lemon juice 15ml (½oz) egg white",
  "History": "This pre- Prohibition cocktail was first published in Hugo R. Ensslin's 1916 Recipes for Mixed Drinks (1st Edition) and was popularised during the 1920s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Los Angeles, USA.",
