  "Review": "A smooth creamy orangey dessert cocktail that is surprisingly boozy and far from overly sweet. However, be warned, it is thick and rich - just as a dessert cocktail should be.",
  "History": "Created in 2002 by yours truly after rediscovering advocaat on a trip to Amsterdam. This cocktail was originally an \"Orange Custard Martini\" - every new cocktail was a Martini in those days. Firstly, for reasons of decency, I switched Martini for Cocktail in the name, then, In January 2019, I reduced the amount of advocaat a tad, swapped the now relatively obscure Tuaca liqueur for brandy, and added the vanilla bitters. I think for the better all around.",
