  "Review": "Delicate, floral, and aromatic, it has a hint of sweetness but not to offend. Despite the lack of juice in this recipe, don't be tempted to stir rather than shake; this is classically a shaken cocktail, and it's all the better for it. At its best, drink whilst still cloudy from shaking.",
