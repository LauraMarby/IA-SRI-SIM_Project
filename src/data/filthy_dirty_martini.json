  "Review": "The transition from a mere Dirty Martini to a Filthy Dirty Martini isn't so much about more olive brine but the addition of lime juice. This introduces citrus freshness (beyond the lemon zest twist) and sourness. Using Old Tom rather than London Dry Gin helps offset lime's sourness while bolstering botanical notes to stand up to the 'dirty' ingredients. Unusually for a cocktail with citrus juice, I recommend you stir this cocktail, but if you prefer your Martinis shaken, then you'll need to dramatically cut back on the vermouth, olive brine and lime juice as shaking amplifies their flavours while masking the gin.",
