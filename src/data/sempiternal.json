  "Review": "“My cocktail is called Sempiternal – an old Saxon word which means something eternal, something with no beginning and no end. There's nothing more endless than time. We can't make it stop or get it back, we can't make it go faster or slower. We can only capture life’s brightest moments, like breathing in our favorite scent, or hearing our favorite sounds, or admiring our favorite scene. Or taking a sip of our favorite BACARDÍ cocktail. “We can't fight time. Sooner or later the moment will pass, just like a good cocktail, leaving us to forever imprint them on our memory and hope to have more of them.”",
