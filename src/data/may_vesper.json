  "Review": "A bone dry and Islay smoked Vesper \"may\" appeal – certainly worth a try if you're into Martinis and Islay whisky.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created by Angus Waugh in Edinburgh, Scotland who originally made this cocktail with Bruichladdich malt whisky and The Botanist gin . He loves Vespers and enjoys Bruichladdich and Botanist gin, plus they are both made at the same distillery. \" With that in mind, I decided to make a Vesper using The Botanist gin and replacing the single measure of vodka in the recipe with a measure of The Classic Laddie (not too peaty). I retained the Lillet Blanc in honour of the \"Auld Alliance\" between Scotland and France in the 13th to 16th centuries. I call the cocktail the \"May Vesper\", May being James Bond's Scottish housekeeper in the Fleming novels. \" Bond's Vesper Martini story",
