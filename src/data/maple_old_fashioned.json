  "Review": "A spirit-forward sipper that's rich and easy with bourbon mellowed by maple syrup.",
  "History": "I first encountered the bourbon-based Maple Old Fashioned in 2004 at Indigo Yard in Edinburgh, Scotland but in more recent years, rum seems to have taken over as the preferred spirit base to make a Maple Rum Old Fashioned . Whichever spirit base you use, makes a delicious riff on the classic Old-Fashioned .",
