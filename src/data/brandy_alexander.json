  "Review": "This after-dinner classic is rich, creamy and subtly chocolaty.",
  "History": "The original Alexander was gin-based, but in the early 1920s, Harry MacElhone , then a bartender at Ciro's in London, is credited with starting the trend of using brandy in place of gin. What became known as the Brandy Alexander quickly displaced the original gin-based cocktail. MacElhone's creation of the brandy-based Alexander is supported by the first recipe for such a cocktail appearing in his 1923 Harry of Ciro's ABC of mixing cocktails",
