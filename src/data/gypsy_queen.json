  "Review": "Vodka both fortifies this complexly spiced honeyed and herbal cocktail.",
  "History": "Drinks historian David Wondrich discovered the earliest known reference to the Gypsy Queen in a 1938 booklet published by New York City's famed The Russian Tea Room . This makes it one of the earliest vodka-cocktails in the USA. In his seminal 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David Embury says, \"The original recipe calls for a proportion of 1 to 2. This, however, is rather sweet. About 5 top 6 parts vodka to 1 of Benedictine makes a much better drink.\" [The above recipe is 3 to 1.] Embury's \"Gypsy or Gypsy Queen\" recipe of 1-part Benedictine and 2 to 6 parts Vodka stipulates \"1 dash Orange Bitters to each drink\" but Angostura or similar aromatic bitters produce a rounder cocktail.",
