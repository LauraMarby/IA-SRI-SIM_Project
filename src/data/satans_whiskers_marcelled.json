  "Review": "This riff on the Satan's Whiskers (in turn a Bronx variation) calls for it not to be 'curled' (as is the case when you use orange curaçao), but to be \"marcelled\", apparently a deep soft wave in one's hair (for those that still have some) created with curling tongs and popular in the 1920s and 1930s.",
