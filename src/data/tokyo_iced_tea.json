  "Review": "You will be surprised how the half shot of melon liqueur shows through the many other ingredients.",
  "History": "When, where and who added green melon liqueur to a Long Island Iced Tea to create the Tokyo Iced Tea is unknown. Who would want to own up to doing such a thing? It's a cocktail I identify with TGI Fridays during the mid-1990s when the chain was known for the professionalism of its bartenders and consequently was very influential. The Tokyo Iced Tea doesn't appear in any of the cocktail books I have from the 1980s, indeed its first appearance in print is credited to Paul Knorr's 2007 10,000 Drinks: 27 Years' Worth of Cocktails .",
