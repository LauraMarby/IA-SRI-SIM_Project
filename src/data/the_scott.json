  "Review": "This golden drink is dry and sophisticated, yet honeyed and approachable.",
  "History": "Adapted from a cocktail discovered in 2006 at The Clift Hotel in San Francisco, USA. My original recipe for this cocktail was 60ml (2oz) Scotch whisky, 15ml (½oz) Drambuie, and 30ml (1oz) dry vermouth which seemed to be liked with 5 ratings at 5/5. However, it was boozy so in June 2020, I reduced the volume of each ingredient to the above with the liqueur ratio very slightly increased and a dash of water added to aid dilution. Or, omit the water and serve over ice.",
