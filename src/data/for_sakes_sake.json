  "Review": "Being dyslexic, I'm bewildered as to how to spell dyslexic while also amused by sake (the beverage brewed from rice) being spelt the same way as sake (as in for f**k's sake!). Hopefully, you'll find this aromatic, subtly orange-influenced sake and rum-based Martini-like cocktail both delightful to drink and easy to spell.",
