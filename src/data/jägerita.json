  "Review": "This Margarita may look a little like liquid mud but is surprisingly tasty with liquorice-forward herbal notes alongside bright citrus.",
  "History": "Origin: Created by David Cordoba and made in September 2008 for yours truly and others to try at my Cabinet Room in London. Jeffrey Morgenthaler , who was among the influential bartenders present that night, took the Jägerita back to Portland, Oregon, where he wrote about that night and David's whacky Margarita on JeffreyMorgenthaler.com. Then, in 2014, he included it on the opening menu of his bar, Pépé Le Moko. Thanks to Morgenthaler's influence, the Jägerita has gone on to become a contemporary classic .",
