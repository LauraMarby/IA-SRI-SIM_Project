  "Review": "A medium-dry Gin Collins based on old tom gin. There is much confusion between Tom Collins and John Collins ; arguably, the two names are interchangeable [see history below]. However, I follow the convention that a Tom Collins is based on old tom gin while a John Collins is made with London dry gin (although a John Collins was originally made with genever. Today, that's a Dutch or Genever Collins ).",
  "History": "In his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , David A. Embury says \" The original Collinses were always made with gin but, strangely enough, never with London dry gin - the very liquor that is practically always used in making a Collins today. The Tom Collins was made with Old Tom gin and the John Collins with Holland gin [jenever]. \" He goes on to explain the confusion/difference between a Tom and John Collins:",
