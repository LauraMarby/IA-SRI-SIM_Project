  "History": "Meaning \"American-style\" in Italian, the name references this cocktail's origins. Italian vermouth producers, picking up on the trend for cocktails in the USA to be based on vermouth with bitters, started marketing vermouths with bitters already added under the name \"vermouth Americano.\" Italian bars then started making their own versions by adding various bittersweet liqueurs, including Fernet Branca, to vermouth. Some also added soda to turn this cocktail into a long drink. Then the popularity of the Milano Torino led to red bitter liqueur (e.g. Campari) being used in preference to amari in an Americano. Mazzon Ferruccio's 1920 book Il Barista Guida del Barman , a \"collection of American and International Recipes\", includes two \"Americano\" recipes, a single serve and a \"Americano (grandi quantità)\" (large quantities). Both illustrate the Americano's origins as vermouth adjusted by adding bitters or bitter liqueurs and other flavourings such as \"5 drops of cognac\".",
