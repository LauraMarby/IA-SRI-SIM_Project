  "History": "Danish Bacardí Legacy 2015 winning cocktail by Jonas B Andersen at Strøm Bar in Copenhagen. Jonas' original recipe calls for 3 x 2cm chunks of fresh celery to be muddled with the lime juice and agave syrup in the base of the shaker before other ingredients are added. We have simply used freshly extracted juice in preference to muddling.",
