  "History": "Adapted from a cocktail created in 1999 by Dick Bradsell for an Agent Provocateur swimwear launch. Invented by designer Louis Réard in July 1946, the bikini swimsuit was named after Bikini Atoll, where the first public test of a nuclear bomb took place four days earlier. At the time, exposing the wearer's navel and buttocks was considered so shocking that no model would wear it, so Réard hired Micheline Bernardini, a nude dancer from the Casino de Paris to model the two-piece swimsuit.
