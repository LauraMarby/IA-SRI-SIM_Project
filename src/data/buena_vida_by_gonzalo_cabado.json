  "Review": "“I have made a cocktail to create a moment and a lasting impression, and inspired by an era of elegance and finesse behind the bar. “In the early 20th Century, The Bartenders Club in Havana, Cuba was the place where all those with good taste came to enjoy the hospitality and cocktails that were banned in the US. BACARDÍ was at the centre of this ‘golden age of cocktails’ – and today it hosts bartenders from around the globe to create, share and display a new generation of drinks that will be part of the BACARDÍ Legacy and culture. I want to honour the grace, virtuosity and graciousness of these bartenders, and add my drink to this legacy.”",
