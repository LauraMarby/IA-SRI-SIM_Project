  "Review": "\"The El Magico cocktail is dedicated to the Bacardi family during its time in Cuba, where in the early 20th century magic and the occult were very popular. Here, Don Facundo Bacardi become a pioneer of the rum industry; he began to make a softer rum, using a charcoal filter, which at the time people thought must have been Facundo's own magic.\" We say : If you are too lazy to make your own honey basil syrup then instead try substituting 7ml Monin basil syrup, 7ml honey syrup and 10ml water. The resulting drink is most unusual and may make you want to experiment with soy milk more. Basil is the lead flavour - giving the finished drink an almost minty freshness. Rum notes are subdued.",
