  "Review": "A quality falernum adds complex clove-led flavours to a classic Trader Vic Mai Tai .",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created by Craig Toone at Kuckoo Boutique Bar, Newton-le-Willows, England. Craig's drink was inspired by the Tiki Margarita, and he told us. \" I looked at cross-breeding two other well-known classics. Therefore, I present the bastard love child of a Mai Tai and Corn & Oil ... Genes carried forward are falernum in place of triple sec and a dash of Angostura bitters to the basic Trader Mai Tai recipe. \"",
