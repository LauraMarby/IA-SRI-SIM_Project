  "Review": "Dry sherry and bitter orange with underlying ripe grape sweetness, The Ribbon makes for a perfect aperitif cocktail.",
  "History": "The Ribbon was created in 2017 at Swift in Soho, London, England, and was originally made with 40% alc./vol. Solerno blood orange liqueur and Cocchi Storico Vermouth di Torino rosso vermouth. My previous interpretation of their recipe comprised: 20ml (2/3oz) Fino sherry 20ml (2/3oz) Cocchi Torino vermouth 10ml (1/3oz) Solerno 10ml Campari liqueur Due to the demise of the availability of Solerno liqueur in the UK, in August 2022, at Swift Bar in Shoreditch, London, I discovered they had switched to Grand Marner so I also adapted my recipe.",
