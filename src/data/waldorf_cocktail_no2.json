  "Review": "Lime works better than lemon but like the Astor , using a combination of lime and lemon produces an even better drink.",
  "History": "This is the later of the two versions of this vintage cocktail from New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel [ Waldorf No.1 ]. It appears in the 1939 Café Royale book and in the 1955 United Kingdom Bartender's Book . Both books offer a choice between using lemon or lime juice and the original recipe calls for two parts Swedish punch to one part gin but with most modern-day Swedish punches this makes for an overly sweet drink.",
