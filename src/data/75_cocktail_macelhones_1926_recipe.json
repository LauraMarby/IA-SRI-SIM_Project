  "Review": "Like the gun this cocktail is named after, this small cocktail packs a hell of a punch, and to ensure it does, MacElhone calls for a couple of dashes of absinthe in place of the lemon juice used in earlier Soixante-Quinze (Seventy-Five) recipes. The result is a dry, spirituous drink.",
