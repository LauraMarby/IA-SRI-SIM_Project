  "Review": "This is the definitive Cosmo recipe from the man most associated with the drink's development and popularity.",
  "History": "In his 2002 The Craft of the Cocktail , Dale DeGroff explains that while he did not invent the Cosmopolitan, \" What I did do was popularize a definitive recipe that became widely accepted as the standard. \" He also gives the above recipe but with just ½oz (15ml) Cointreau, a measure which he increased to ¾oz (22.5ml) for the 2020 Revised Edition of his book. This could be as much due to a reduction of sugar in Cointreau to conform with fashion since Dale created his recipe at Manhattan's Rainbow Rooms in the mid-1990s as his revisiting and polishing an old recipe.",
