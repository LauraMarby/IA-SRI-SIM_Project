  "Review": "Bourbon's distinctive character shines through but is softened and flavoured by cacao and a hint of citrus.",
  "History": "Gary Regan adapted Ted Haigh's original Delmarva Cocktail and published both versions in his 2003 Joy of Mixology . Garry's recipe calls for 2oz straight rye whiskey, ½oz dry vermouth, ½oz white crème de cacao and ½oz lemon juice but, depending on your crème de cacao, this can be on the sour side so I've opted for bourbon, bianco vermouth and reduced the lemon a tad.",
