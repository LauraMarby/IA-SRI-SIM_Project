  "Review": "This tequila (in place of gin) based riff on a White Lady is basically a straight-up Margarita made with lemon rather than lime, softened and smoothed by egg white. This is a delightful drink. Go easy spraying the zest, as this can overly dominate the drink. It also works best with light agave syrup, as the darker versions affect its virgin-like hue and can add unwanted caramel notes.",
