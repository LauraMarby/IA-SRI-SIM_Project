  "History": "In its native Brazil it is usual to serve this drink with cubed ice (actually most usually holly tubular machine ice) but the drink travelled to, and became popular the UK at a time when the use of crushed ice was fashionable, so in this and other 'new' cachaça markets the use of crushed ice has become the norm.
