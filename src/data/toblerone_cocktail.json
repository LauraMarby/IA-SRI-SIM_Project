  "Review": "Nibble at the garnish as you sip honeyed, chocolate and almond-flavoured liquid candy. Yumm. Best made with a gold (1-3 yer old) light rum infused with a vanilla pod, rather than a commercially produced vanilla-flavoured rum.",
  "History": "Created in 2003 by yours truly and originally named the Triangular Martini after the triangular Toblerone chocolate bar, which incidentally was invented in 1908 by the Swiss chocolate maker Theodor Tobler. The chocolate bar's name is a blend of Tobler with Torrone, the Italian word for honey-almond nougat, one of its main ingredients.",
