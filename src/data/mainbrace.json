  "Review": "Tangy grapefruit laced with gin and a hint of orange. Tart finish.",
  "History": "This gin-based cocktail takes its name from a Navy term, usually associated with rum. However, while the ratings on British Navy ships drank rum, their officers sipped gin. Braces are the ropes that control the angle of the sails on square-rigged ships, and the mainbrace is the longest rope in the rigging. If the mainbrace were shot away during a battle, then the ship would be rendered unmaneuverable. The mainbrace runs through blocks, so it cannot be repaired with a short splice or a knot. Instead, a long splice is needed, so even outside of battle, this is a difficult and skilled job. Hence, it was customary for the men who spliced the mainbrace to be rewarded with an extra ration of rum. Over time, the order to \" splice the mainbrace \" came to mean that the whole crew would receive an extra ration of rum, issued after victory or to celebrate a special occasion such as a royal birth.",
