  "Name": "Mint Daiquiri",
  "Glass": "Coupe glass",
  "Ingredients": [
    "12 fresh Mint leaves",
    "30 ml Light white rum (charcoal-filtered 1-4 years old)",
    "30 ml Gold rum (1-3 years old pot & column blend)",
    "22.5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)",
    "15 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°Brix)",
    "10 ml Chilled water omit if using wet ice",
    "6 drop Difford's Daiquiri Bitters"
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    "Lightly MUDDLE (just to bruise) mint in base of shaker. Add other ingredients, SHAKE with ice and fine strain into chilled glass. (Even with a fine strainer, if your finished cocktail doesn't end up with tiny fragments of mint on the surface, you've not shaken hard enough.)"

  "Review": "Reminiscent of a short, concentrated Mojito , this Daiquiri works well with either a charcoal filtered 'carta blanca' style light rum or a lightly aged 'gold' rum. The former produces a brighter and fresher Daiquiri, while the latter arguably has more character. In a quest for the best of both worlds, I've used equal parts of both rums.",
