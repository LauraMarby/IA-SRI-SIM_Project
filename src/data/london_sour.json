  "Review": "Our thanks to Brent Evans for pointing us towards this tasty cocktail which he describes as \"Scotch whisky blended with fresh oranges, lemons and a whisper of almond.\" We tried with egg white, usually our preference in a sour, but prefer this one without the resulting foam. We also found upping the orange juice and serving long preferable.",
