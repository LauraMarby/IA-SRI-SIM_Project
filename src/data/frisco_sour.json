  "Review": "A bourbon-laced sour with monastic herbal notes.",
  "History": "The Frisco Sour started life as a mere Frisco, sans Sour (egg white) in Lucius-Beebe's 1946 The Stock Club Bar Book . \" Frisco Cocktail: 2 oz bourbon ¾ oz Benedictine twist of lemon peel Stir and serve in 3oz. cocktail glass. \" The original Frisco is a tad sweet and is much improved with a dash or two of orange bitters to bolster the lemon oils from the twist. This obviously led a bartender somewhere to add citrus juice. In Stanley M. Jones 1977 Jones' Complete BarGuide he lists the above Frisco but with 2oz bourbon and ½oz Benedictine followed by a sour version: \" Frisco Sour Sour glass                         Shake ½ oz lemon juice ¼ oz lime juice ¾ oz Benedictine 1-¼ oz whiskey ¼ tsp sugar Lemon wedge, lime wheel \" Once this cocktail morphed into a sour then the addition of egg white was a natural progression, which I believe came in the 1990s when this was a popular cocktail in the London bar scene. That's when I first encountered the Frisco Sour which was by then served on-the-rocks. However, it also works well, as per Jones' recipe, strained into a stemmed sour glass or coupe.",
