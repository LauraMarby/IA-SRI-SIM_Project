  "Review": "It is perhaps best described as a Trinidadian Daiquiri due to its heavy use of Angostura Bitters. According to Owen Rutter, it was also originally made with Trinidad gold rum, Canning's Caroni Rum. (If using homemade 2:1 pomegranate syrup rather than grenadine, use 15ml (½oz) and omit sugar syrup.)",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from If Crab No Walk: A Traveller in the West Indies , a 1932 book written by British travel writer Owen Rutter, who writes of the Queen's Park Hotel, Port of Spain, Trinidad, \" The cooking is good; the servants, though slow, are attentive; there is an excellent ballroom, a first-rate band, and a good bar: 'the Long Bar with the Brass Rail,' where you may drink the Queen's Park Hotel Super Cocktail. \"",
