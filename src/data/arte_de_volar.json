  "Review": "Tequila replaces gin in this Margarita -like riff on an Aviation cocktail – 'Arte de Volar' is Spanish for 'Art of Flying'. As with the original gin-based classic, notes of violet subtly influence with citrus juice freshening and adding balance.",
  "History": "Created in February 2017 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England. I modified this recipe in May 2020 by switching from lemon to lime juice and from maraschino liqueur to lavender syrup. A move further away from the Aviation but to a better cocktail. My original 2017 Arte de Volar recipe: 1¾ Blanco tequila ½ Maraschino liqueur ¼ Crème de violet ½ Freshly squeezed lemon juice",
