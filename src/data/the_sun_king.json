  "Review": "Jay explained the origins of this drink as follows, \" Whilst on holiday in the south of France this summer I discovered a fig tree growing on the riverside near our Chateau. During dinner, my family challenged me to make a drink with the figs. I raided the cupboards and found Martell VSOP, chocolate liqueur, tawny port and drinking chocolate. The rest is History! I hope you enjoy it! \"",
