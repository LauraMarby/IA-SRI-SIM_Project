  "Review": "A dry, orangey, herbal, gin-laced aperitivo, closely related to the better known Bronx .",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe first published in Harry Craddock 's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book and repeated in William James \"Billy\" Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Bar Book . Although one of the earliest cocktails on our database (the third), the Abbey was brought to our attention for a long overdue update by Jason E. Clapham of St. Edward's MCR at Oxford, England who recommends making it with Cocchi Americano as a substitute for the now sadly discontinued Kina Lillet used in the 1930 recipe.",
