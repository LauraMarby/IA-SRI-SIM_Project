  "History": "Some call a bourbon-based Collins a \"John Collins\". A John Collins was originally made with genever, then old tom gin and finally London dry gin. The misappropriation of the name John Collins for a whiskey-based Collins is explained in a notation under the Holland Gin-based John Collins recipe in Stanley M. Jones' 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide . \" Note: Since Holland Gin is in few bars, Bourbon is often substituted to get the Holland Gin heavier effect.  Holland Gin is also \"malty\" so Scotch would also be a good substitute. \"",
