  "Review": "This is simply whisky and water, but as with the Japanese tea ceremony, observing the time and care taken over it making and the prolonged anticipation contributes greatly to the finished drink. And you thought an Old Fashioned took a long time.",
  "History": "Pronounced \"Miz-Zoo-Wah-ri\", which translates as \"mizu\" = water and \"wari\" = divide, thus the whisky is simply cut with water and served over ice. The ratio is personal to both the drinker and bartender and varies between 1:2.5 and 1:4 whisky to water. It is common in Japan for diners to drink Mizuwari in place of wine with their meals and the light whisky flavours combine excellently with Japanese food. Extremely thin, delicate glasses are used and the thickness and quality of glass are considered key to Mizuwari in Japan.",
