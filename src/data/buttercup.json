  "Ingredients": [

  "Instructions": [
    "Select and pre-chill a Coupe glass .",
    "Prepare garnish of the original recipe calls for a lemon zest twist but the lemon oils overpower the butterscotch. So if you use a slither of lemon skin on which to nestle a Werther's Original, don't express the lemon's oils over the drink. WARNING: Don't be tempted to use buttercup flowers as they are poisonous. They are also poisonous when eaten by livestock but their acrid taste and the blistering of the mouth they cause mean that animals don't tend to eat them. Interestingly, the toxins degrade when dried, so hay containing dried buttercups is safe for animals to eat..",

  "Review": "When made to Lucas Bols original specification: 1 shot Bols Genever, 1 shot Bols Butterscotch liqueur and ¾ shot sweet vermouth, this drink has a great flavour but lacks balls (or perhaps I should say Bols). Hence, the above formula is heavy on the genever with equal parts butterscotch liqueur and sweet vermouth. It's even better with an oude genever rather than a jonge as this amplifies the butterscotch notes.",
  "History": "My adaptation of a recipe I discovered in January 2014 at The House of Bols in Amsterdam, Netherlands.",
