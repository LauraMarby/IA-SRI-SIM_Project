  "Review": "Martini drinkers of the gin/vodka and vermouth variety will describe this drink as being all too flat and all too white, but for lovers of flat white coffees and cream liqueurs, this Martini will hit the spot – even though it's not really a Martini.",
  "History": "Developed in Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s, a \"flat white\" is a coffee made by pouring frothy, velvety steamed milk over a double shot of espresso. It is similar to a cappuccino or a latte, but is smaller in volume and with a higher proportion of coffee to milk. As Dick Bradsell 's Espresso Martini became a mass-market cocktail in the first half of the Noughties, so the marketers at Baileys Irish Cream started to promote this cocktail.",
