  "Review": "Port and brandy (rhymes 'Randy') are traditionally consumed at Christmas and used to be a popular British pub combo. I've used maple syrup in place of brown sugar syrup to lightly sweeten this festive after-dinner combo. The Sazerac was the inspiration for the choice of bitters and use of absinthe.",
