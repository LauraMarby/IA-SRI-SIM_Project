  "History": "Bar legend says the Southside (or South Side) was created during Prohibition , either at a New York City speakeasy called Jack & Charlie's, or at Manhattan's Stork Club, or by Chicago's Southside mobsters to make their bootleg liquor more palatable, while on the other side of town hoodlums enjoyed the Northside (gin and ginger ale). The truth is more mundane and the Southside evolved from the Mint Julep at Snedecor's Tavern, Long Island in the 1890s when the style of drink known as a Fizz was at the height of its popularity. The club later became the Southside Sportsman's Club. This cocktail is also closely associated with New York's Twenty-One Club. The South Side Fizz features in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 Recipes for Mixed Drinks but over the decades has morphed into the South Side Rickey served over cracked ice and more recently to the Southside served straight-up without soda.",
