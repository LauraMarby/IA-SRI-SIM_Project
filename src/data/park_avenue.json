  "Review": "Very fruity and well-balanced rather than dry or sweet. The recipe previously on this page was in line with that in the 1977 Jones' Complete Barguide : 50ml (1 2/3oz) Dry gin 20ml (2/3oz) Pineapple juice 10ml (2/3oz) Orange Curaçao 10ml (1/3oz) Rosso (sweet) vermouth But thanks to a comment by Clarence Castillo (see below), in February 2023 I adopted Ted Haigh's 2009 Park Avenue. Then, a month later, thanks to further encouragement from Clarence, I dropped the gin back a tad and added Daiquiri (roasted pineapple & mint bitters).",
  "History": "A degree of mystery surrounds this vintage cocktail, partly due to its first known appearance in a recipe book, Dexter Mason's 1930 The Art of Living , being quite a different recipe to that recognised as a Park Avenue today.",
