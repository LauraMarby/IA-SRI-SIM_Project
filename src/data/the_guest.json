  "Review": "\"The Guest is born of the conversations I have had with the regular guests that visit my bar. Building a relationship with them allows me to learn what they like and introduce them to new flavour experiences that open the world of mixology to them. Soon they learn to appreciate different styles of drinks using sweet, sour, bitter, complex and robust ingredients, giving them the confidence to order what they like.  The Guest is named for them, and inspired by them. It takes the flavours preferred by my most regular guests and interprets these using my personality as a bartender.\" We say : Vaguely reminiscent of a rum laced Black Forest gateau.",
