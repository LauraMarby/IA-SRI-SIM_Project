  "Review": "This 1915 recipe, originally of equal parts gin, applejack and grenadine (1/3 of each to 1/6 lemon juice) makes this Soixante-Quinze (Seventy-Five) a tad on the sweet side (certainly sweet if you are using a proprietary or housemade 2:1 grenadine). However, who knows what brix the original grenadine/pomegranate syrup was, so we've eased back the grenadine to bring modern-day ingredients more into kilter. The resulting drink (which benefits from a splash of water to aid dilution) remains more a fruity, spirituous after-dinner cocktail rather than an aperitif.",
