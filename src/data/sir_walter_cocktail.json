  "History": "The Sir Walter (or Swalter) first appears in Harry MacElhone's 1927 Barflies and Cocktails and is repeated in other regarded tomes such as The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930). Whether this cocktail honours Sir Walter Raleigh or Sir Walter Scott is a matter of conjecture, but as MacElhone, who heralded from Dundee, Scotland, is thought to be the drinks' creator, many favour Scott as being the protagonist.",
