  "Review": "I like both spirit-forward cocktails and gin, so although the original recipe calls for equal parts gin and dry vermouth, I previously opted for two-parts (60ml/2oz) old tom gin to one part (30ml/1oz) dry vermouth with 10ml (⅓oz) Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur (not Bénédictine B&B ) with an all essential two dashes of orange bitters and orange zest twist. However, respecting the original recipe and comments made by fellow Discerning Drinkers, I have switched to the present equal parts old tom gin and dry vermouth. The original recipe also specifies a mere \"three dashes of Bénédictine D.O.M. (B&B was not made back then), but even 7.5ml (¼oz) is not enough, so I've stuck with a whopping 10ml (⅓oz). The orange bitters and zest remain essential to this cocktail's success.",
