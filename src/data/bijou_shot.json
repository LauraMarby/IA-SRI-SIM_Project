  ],
  "Review": "A shot loaded with bold flavours best suited to fans of Chartreuse.",
  "History": "This vintage layered, or 'pousse-café' style drink is named after the French for 'jewel', apparently a reference to its trio of ingredients having the colours of the three most precious jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and emerald (Green Chartreuse). If all the ingredients, and so the colours, are mixed together the result is a rather better ' Bijou #1 ', also aptly named Amber Dream due to its colour. If I were you I wouldn't bother with this layered drink, grab a stirring glass and enjoy an Amber Dream.",
