  "Review": "This drink is often mixed in the glass in which it is to be served. Shaking better incorporates the flavours produced by muddling and fine straining removes the orange peel and cherry skin.",
  "History": "Orange and lemon segments, and sometimes even a maraschino cherry, are sometimes muddled when making an Old Fashioned. The practise probably originated during Prohibition as a means of disguising rough spirits. This practice is almost unknown outside North America. In the Foreword to his 1945 Cocktail Guide and Ladies' Companion , Lucus Beebe recants the reaction of a bartender at Chicago's Drake Hotel when ordering \"an Old Fashioned without fruit except for lemon.\" \"Yong impudent sir\", he screamed, \"my hair is hoary–with eld,\" he added as an afterthought. \"Man and boy I've built Old Fashioned cocktails these sixty years. Yes, sir, since the first Armour was pushing a wheelbarrow in a slaughterhouse, and I have never yet had the perverted nastiness of mind to put fruit in an Old Fashioned. \" Old-Fashioned cocktail history",
