  "Review": "Sloe gin is the 'Slow', Sothern Comfort is the 'Comfortable', vodka and orange juice are the 'Screw' (as in Screwdriver ), ice is the 'Cold', overproof rum the 'Hard' and Galliano the 'Wall' (as in Harvey Wallbanger ). The result is a much better drink than the sleazy name might suggest, at least it is when freshly squeezed orange juice is used.",
