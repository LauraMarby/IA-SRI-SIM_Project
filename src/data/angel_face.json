  "Review": "Rich apricot and apple with a backbone of botanical gin. Balanced rather than dry or sweet. This cocktail looks better when stirred, but Harry Craddock's original 1930 recipe is shaken, and the extra dilution helps mellow this spirit-forward classic. Hence, I've added a splash of water to increase the dilution of the stirred recipe. Although an act of heresy, a splash of processed and packaged clear \"apple juice drink\" also works in place of added chilled water.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe in Harry Craddock 's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book which stipulates \"Shake well and strain into cocktail glass,\" rather than to stir as modern convention dictates.",
