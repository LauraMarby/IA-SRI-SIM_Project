  "Review": "A refreshing balance of sour lemon and sugar, laced with London dry gin and lengthened with soda. Some know this cocktail as a Tom Collins, understandably so, but a Tom Collins is based on old tom gin, while a John Collins is based on London dry gin. I borrow the wise words of David A. Embury (below) to address this confusion on our Tom Collins page.",
  "History": "It would appear that the Collins morphed from the Gin Punch, a popular drink of the day and its creation and name are attributed to John (or possibly Jim) Collins,  head waiter at Limmer's Hotel on Conduit Street in London during the late 1800s. The 'coffee house' of Limmer's Hotel was a true dive bar, popular with sporting types during the 19th century and famous, according to the 1860s memoirs of Captain Gronow (a Victorian writer of four observational tomes) for its Gin Punch as early as 1814. John Collins is immortalised in an 1892 limerick written by Frank and Charles Sheridan about John Collins:",
