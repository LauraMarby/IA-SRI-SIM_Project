  "Review": "A Dry Martini delicately influenced by rich marsala and almond notes.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created circa 2013 by Tony Conigliaro at 69 Colebrooke Row . Tony C's original recipe calls for 50ml London dry gin, 10ml marsala dolce (sweet marsala), 5ml dry vermouth and 3 dashes of 69 Colebrooke Row-housemade almond bitters. Lacking 69 Colebrooke Row's lab kit or the patience to use it, I subbed amaretto for the almond bitters and used a semisecco (medium) marsala. See Martini cocktail history and evolution",
