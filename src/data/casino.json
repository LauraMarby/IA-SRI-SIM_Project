  "Review": "This recipe is a broad interpretation of Jacob A. Didier's 1909 original and the Casino recipes that follow in Hugo R. Ensslin's 1916 book and other subsequent tomes. Although, as Didier merely specifies \"dashes\" of lemon juice, his recipe may not be so far removed from mine.",
  "History": "Until March 2014, when Henry Duke, a fellow discerning Drinker, made me aware that the Casino first appeared in Jacob A. Didier's 1909 book The Reminder: Up-To-Date Bartender' Vest Pocket Guide [thanks, Henry], I and most others credited Hugo R. Ensslin for debuting the recipe in his 1916 Recipes For Mixed Drinks , written when he was head bartender at New York City's Hotel Wallick which stood at the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street. It would appear that Ensslin copied Didier as the recipes in both books are almost identical.",
