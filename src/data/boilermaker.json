  "Name": "Boilermaker",
  "Glass": "Shot glass",
  "Ingredients": [
    "30 ml Bourbon whiskey",
    "1 pint Pilsner lager"
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    "POUR whiskey to brim of shot glass and then manoeuvre shot glass so it is held tight up against the inside base of an upturned Boston glass. Then quickly flip the Boston glass over so that the bourbon is trapped in the now upside-down shot glass. Now pour beer into Boston glass over the whiskey-filled shot glass."
  ],
  "Review": "When you get to the end of the beer the shot glass lifts and the whiskey is released as a chaser. I should point out that in these days of discernment, a Boiler Maker is most commonly a glass of beer served with a shot glass of whiskey alongside – NOT one inside the other. It is also increasingly common for the beer and the whiskey to be specifically selected due to their flavours complementing one another. Beer and whiskey matchmaking.",
