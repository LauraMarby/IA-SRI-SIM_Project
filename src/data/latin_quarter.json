  "History": "Swedish Bacardí Legacy 2013 winning cocktail created by Boudy Ghostine at Miss Voon in Stockholm, Sweden. Boudy says, \" Two classic drinks that were invented in Cuba inspired me: the Original Daiquiri with Bacardí Carta Blanca and the Cuba Libre with Bacardí Oro . All the ingredients in the cocktail have a connection or a bond with the Latin culture: the rum was originally made in Cuba and is now made now in Puerto Rico; Coca Cola came to Cuba around 1900 and was used to make the Cuba Libre, Mexican or Brazilian lime fruit and finally sherry, a tribute to Don Facundo who was a wine merchant. I present to you the Latin Quarter cocktail, a future classic with a great history behind it. \"",
