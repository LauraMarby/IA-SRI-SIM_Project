  "History": "In his 1935 The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book A.S. Crockett describes the Fin de Siècle as a very different drink to the above, a \" Tom Collins with grenadine and raspberry syrup. \" He adds, \" Name dates it back to 1899 or 1900, when the term was much used, but much mispronounced. \" In the \"Baptismal\" chapter he says, \" The Fin de Siècle came toward the end of the century, when the expression became current in magazines and newspapers, and when lots of Americans were taking their first steps in French. What they said when they meant to order such a cocktail is another matter. \"",
