  "Review": "A blend of white spirits sweetened and melon flavoured by the addition of green-coloured melon liqueur.",
  "History": "This recipe is an interpretation of the notorious Hand Grenade cocktail served by the three Tropical Isle Bars and the Funky Pirate on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, USA. Pam Fortner and Earl Bernhardt founded their Tropical Isle bar for the Louisiana World Exposition in 1984 and with the bar came its melon-flavoured Hand Grenade signature cocktail. Marketed under the trademarked strapline \"New Orleans Most Powerful Drink\" and, since 1992, served in long plastic half-yard hand-grenade shaped vessels, this green melon flavoured proprietary drink is available as a pre-mix by mail order from tropicalisle.com. The recipe used to make this and the cocktails served in the Tropical Isle bars is a well-kept secret. Beware, in the USA the operators of Tropical Isle have trademarked Hand Grenade so preventing other establishments not licensed by Tropical Isle from selling cocktails of this name.",
