  "Review": "Almond and lemon flavoured gin. Subtle, citrus and, despite generous orgeat, fairly dry.",
  "History": "This cocktail first appears in David A. Embury 's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks so establishing a 'made before' date. Little else is known but based upon its name, folk suggest it originated at The Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C.. The club's lounge is also said to be \"where the famous Daiquiri cocktail was introduced to the United States.\" Thanks to Embury, we know the original recipe comprised a 2:1:1 formula, but the lawyer-turned-cocktail writer opts for an 8:2:1 formula, describing the original formulation as \"horrible\". I've ended up with an 8:3:2 formula in the quest for balance and deliciousness.",
