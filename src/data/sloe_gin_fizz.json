  "Review": "With the right brand of sloe gin and champagne, this citrusy berry cocktail is just on the dry/tart side of balanced (add more sugar or choose your sloe gin according to taste). Obviously, when made with soda rather than sparkling wine this is a quite different but still tasty cocktail. There is no need to add egg white, and its addition detracts from this cocktail.",
  "History": "\" Its haunting pink color and fruity opulence are topped with a handsome collar of natural foam which, if the sloe gin be of first quality, is gladsome aplenty. \" We have David Wondrich to thank for uncovering this quote about the Sloe Gin Fizz by Lawton Mackall in the August 1941 issue of Esquire .",
