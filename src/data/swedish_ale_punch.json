  "Review": "The grapefruit hop notes in the beer are amplified by fresh grapefruit juice while the beer's cereal notes are fortified with bourbon. Meanwhile, Swedish Punch both sweetens and adds flavour. Swedish Punch (also known as Arrack Punch, Caloric Punch or Punsch) is a style of liqueur popular in Sweden and other Nordic countries. It's based on Batavia arrack (and other spices) which was first introduced from Java by the East Indian Company in 1773.",
