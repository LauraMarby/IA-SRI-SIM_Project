  "Review": "Citrus sourness drowns the Scotch whisky in the original equal parts recipe of this Sidecar made with Scotch in place of cognac (although, I suspect the likes of Cointreau used to contain more sugar so with a time machine the original spec. may have been balanced, and perhaps rather tasty).",
  "History": "The recipe for the Silent Third appears in two 1937 books: William James \"Billy\" Tarling's 1937 Café Royal Bar Book and Approved Cocktails by The United Kingdom Bartenders' Guild to which Tarling was one of the contributors. The recipe in one book is expressed in fractions and the other as percentages, otherwise they are identical.",
