  "Review": "Eric Tecosky's original recipe for this cocktail calls for 1.25oz of Jack Daniel's Single Barrel instead of the combination of Tennessee and rye whiskies used here. Being a mix of split base spirits and liqueurs, it was stirred, as you'd expect such a combination. However, somewhat reminiscent of Shakerato , the Sunset Strip seems to benefit from the aeration and extra dilution provided by shaking. Hence, this is the method I've chosen.",
