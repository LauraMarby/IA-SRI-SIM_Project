  "Review": "One of those Angostura heavy (very heavy) cocktails that intuition says shouldn't work, but thanks to the rich balancing properties of almond syrup and pineapple, it is not only balanced but tasty. The genever base justifies the perhaps misspelt name and adds its distinctive character. (The name may come from Dutchess County in New York State).",
