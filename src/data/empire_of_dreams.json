  "Review": "A Pineapple Daiquiri with apricot and almond shaken with coffee beans. With good ice and a brisk shake, you'll be surprised how much the coffee beans are broken up, so also impacting this fruity cocktail. (Be sure to have a strainer in your sink when you dump the spoils from your tin.)",
