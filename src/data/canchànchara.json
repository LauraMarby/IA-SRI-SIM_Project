  "Review": "Your choice of honey and rum will greatly affect the flavour and, indeed, the success of the finished cocktail. More flavoursome honey demands a more robust rum, so best you're guided by what your local beekeeper supplies. Achieve the perfect balance between sweet honey and sour lime and this is a truly great cocktail.",
  "History": "Known as the forerunner of the Daiquiri and drunk by Cuban revolutionaries fighting off the Spanish at the end of the nineteenth century, the Canchànchara is a simple mix of honey, citrus and rum (originally aguardiente de caña rather than rum). Although there is some debate as to its origins, most historians favour the Ten Years War, 1868-78. Anistatia Miller and Jared Brown, in their book Cuban Cocktails , say it was certainly present at the height of the 1898 Spanish-American Civil War.",
