  "Review": "A vintage French riff on a Negroni . This cocktail is perhaps better, certainly easier drinking when served on-the-rocks.",
  "History": "This vintage cocktail is named after Lucien Gaudin, a French fencer who achieved gold medals with two different weapons at the 1924 Olympics in Paris and the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. After retiring from competitive sport, Gaudin became a journalist and also co-owner of Les Films Sportifs, a sports media company noted for producing the film of the 1924 Olympics, now known as \"the real Chariots of Fire Olympics.\" Sadly, the company was not a financial success and Gaudin committed suicide in 1934 following its bankruptcy. The cocktail, which won the Honorary Cup at the Professional Bartenders Championship in Paris on 2nd February 1929, first appears in the Cocktails de Paris Présentes book, published the same year. This credits the recipe to Charlie of Le Cheval Pie (The Black And White Horse), a Parisian restaurant that operated between 1925 and 1930 where Gaudin is thought to have been a regular.",
