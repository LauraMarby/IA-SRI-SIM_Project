  "Review": "Tangy, fruity and packed with flavour. Clove spice, fragrant floral pisco and elderflower with a hint of sweet pineapple and sour grapefruit. (If pimento dram is not available, then, in place of this, muddle two cloves in the base of the shaker before adding the other ingredients and shaking with ice.)",
  "History": "Created in 2006 by yours truly and amended (thanks to a comment by Donald Draper below) in December 2021 to use 1.25ml pimento dram in place of 2 muddled cloves. This is a riff on the classic the Pisco Punch which was made famous before Prohibition at San Francisco's legendary Bank Exchange Bar. The wedge-shaped Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper now stands on the site of The Bank Exchange, at the corner of Washington & Montgomery Streets, hence this drink's name and wedge-shaped garnish.",
