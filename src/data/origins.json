  "Review": "A pinky red daiquiri with ginger spice, sweet pomegranate and Rioja wine.",
  "History": "Created in 2010 by John O'Reilly at the Apartment, Belfast, Northern Ireland. This adaptation of the classic Daiquiri was inspired by the man who created Bacardi rum and his move from Spain to Cuba. The Rioja represents Don Facundo's Spanish homeland, the pomegranate was taken by the Spanish to the New World and so stands for the journey itself, while the ginger represents the heat and spice of the Caribbean.",
