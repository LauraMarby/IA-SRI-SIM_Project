  "History": "A variation on the Alaska cocktail , the Nome is mentioned in the Alaska cocktail's entry in David Embury's 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks . Like the Alaska, the Nome is thought to take its name from its golden colour referencing the gold rush. The Alaska Gold Rush started in the Klondike region of the Yukon in Canada but many prospectors left the Klondike for an area around Nome in west Alaska following the discovery of gold there in 1899.",
