  "Review": "It is not uncommon to see Bijou recipes with equal parts gin, Chartreuse and sweet vermouth, as called for in Harry Johnson's Bartender's Manual . In fact, that's the norm. Equal parts work, but it makes for a cocktail strong enough to drop a rhinoceros with Chartreuse overly dominant (and I love Chartreuse). The word 'bijou' is French for 'jewel', and this cocktail's name is said to have been inspired by the jewel-like colours of the ingredients: diamond for gin, ruby for rosso vermouth and emerald for Chartreuse Verte.",
  "History": "A cocktail named Bijou first appeared in C. F. Lawlor's 1895 book The Mixicologist as equal parts gin, Grand Marnier and sweet vermouth. This recipe is adapted from Harry Johnson 's 1900 Bartender's Manual , which calls for \"1/3 wine glass Chartreuse (green); 1/3 wine glass vermouth (Italian); 1/3 wine glass of Plymouth gin; 1 dash orange bitters\".",
