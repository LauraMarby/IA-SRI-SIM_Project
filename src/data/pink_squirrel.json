  "History": "The Pink Squirrel was created in 1941 by Bryant Sharp at Bryant's Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Apparently, the original recipe called for ice cream rather than cream and indeed the Pink Squirrel may have started life as a milkshake spiked with spirits prior to Repeal. Considering it unnecessary, in the 1960s, Bryant's second owner, Pat Malmberg removed the crème de cacao from the original recipe and this is how Bryant's make their Pink Squirrels to this day. We're indebted to Michael Lazar (AKA Mr. Manhattan) and his Stirred Not Shaken for researching the origin of this cocktail, and there's more detail on Bryant's and the Pink Squirrel on his blog.",
