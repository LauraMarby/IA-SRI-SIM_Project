  "Review": "Rich honey balances tart lemon juice over a characterful rum-base. Most recipes omit the orange juice, but as David Embury says in his Bee's Knees recipe (more from him below), \" The addition of a small amount of orange juice (about 1 to 2 parts) makes for an interesting variation. \" The additional subtle fruitiness also sits well with Jamaican rum funk.",
  "History": "The 1949 edition of Esquire's Handbook for Hosts says a Honey Bee is \"1 part honey, 4 parts Bacardi, 1 part lemon juice. Mix well, then add ice and shake.\" However, in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , under his recipe for a Bee's Knees , David Embury handily explains, \" The same drink except for the use of white Cuban rum in place of gin, is known as the Honeysuckle . The same drink with Jamaica rum is the Honey Bee. The Honeysuckle is also sometimes called the Airmail. Since Embury's era, an Airmail has become accepted as being a Honeysuckle lengthened with champagne.",
