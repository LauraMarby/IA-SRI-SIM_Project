  "Review": "It's is possible, indeed probable, that the original Pimm's Cup served in the eponymous London bar was in fact based on old tom gin rather than London dry gin. However, while flavoursome, old tom does inherently produce a sweeter style drink compared to when the same recipe is made with dry gin or other base spirits.",
