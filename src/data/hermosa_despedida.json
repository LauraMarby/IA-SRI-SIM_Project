  "Review": "“Hermosa Despedida is Spanish for 'beautiful goodbye' - Facundo BACARDÍ left Sitges in Spain for Cuba in 1830 and this 'goodbye' would lead to the creation of a revolutionary new rum. This cocktail also pays tribute to Ernest Hemingway, by balancing aspects of the 'Hemingway Daiquiri' with cucumber, flowers and bitter lemon soda. The result is a refreshing drink, to be served day or night and enjoyed by men and women alike.”",
