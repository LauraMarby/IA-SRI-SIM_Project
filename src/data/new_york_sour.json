  "Review": "A classic bourbon-based Whiskey Sour made more interesting – both visually and in flavour by the addition of a float of red wine. Egg white is not classically used in a New York Sour but some prefer this drink with the mouthfeel and change of appearance egg white imparts. British bartenders may prefer the following formula based on UK measures: 50 ml Bourbon whiskey 25 ml Lemon juice 12.5 ml Sugar syrup (2:1) 1 dash Angostura bitters 12.5 ml Egg white (optional) 12.5 ml Claret red wine",
  "History": "Thought to have been first made in the 1880s by a bartender in Chicago, this drink was originally named the Continental Sour and then Southern Whiskey Sour, also masquerading as a Brunswick Sour and Claret Snap before becoming best known as the New York Sour, probably after a bartender in Manhattan started serving the drink and made it popular. It first appears in print under the New York Sour name in print in the 1934 Mr. Boston Bartender's Guide . History of Sours family of cocktails and more recipies",
