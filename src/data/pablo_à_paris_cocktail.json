  "Review": "A dry and angular aperitif with robust flavours of aged rhum agricole and gentian liqueur, lengthened and tamed by dry vermouth with dashes of absinthe.",
  "History": "Adapted from a drink created in March 2015 by Julian de Féral of the Gorgeous Group for Culinaire Bazaar, Paris, France. Inspired by Picasso and the time he spent in Paris, where at the turn of the 20th century he painted one of his most important and influential masterpieces, Les Demoiselles d'Avognon. As well as being fond of absinthe, Picasso painted a cubist interpretation of a Suze bottle. To quote Julian, \"the use of rhum agricole draws parallels between the African influence on Picasso and the culture in Caribbean French colonies.\" Julian's original recipe calls for Barbancourt 8 rhum agricole, Suze and Dolin Blanc.",
