  "Review": "Loaded with booze and with an aqua marine blue hue (as the name suggests), this citrusy drink was made for the 1980s. We're sure Del Boy would have described it as being \"cushty\" or even \"lovely jubbly\".",
  "History": "This cocktail takes both its name and blue hue from Blue Aqua Velva aftershave which urban myth purports was consumed by sailors during WWII for its alcohol content. At some point, probably the 1980s, someone created this cocktail in homage to the fragrance. In the 2007 American mystery-thriller movie Zodiac with Jake Gyllenhaal playing Robert Graysmith a Political cartoonist who receives and interprets encrypted letters from the killer who calls himself the \"Zodiac\", this cocktail is depicted as being the character's preferred drink.",
