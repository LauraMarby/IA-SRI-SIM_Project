  "Review": "The full flavour of Old Tom gin adds an extra dimension to this classic Gin Fizz. Indeed, it is probably the original Gin Fizz.",
  "History": "Said to be the original name and recipe of the Ramos Gin Fizz, created in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on the corner of Gravier and Carondelet Streets in New Orleans. Today, a New Orleans Gin Fizz is made with Old Tom gin while a Ramos Gin Fizz is made with London Dry gin. While today's Ramos Gin Fizz always has added rose water and sometimes vanilla essence, the New Orleans Gin Fizz usually relies on the use of Old Tom gin for its flavour nuances.",
