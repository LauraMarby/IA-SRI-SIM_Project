  "Review": "This flavoursome, three equal parts cocktail has a lightly sweet palate followed by a dry finish. An interesting balance of blackcurrant, vermouth and gin. Some might describe it as \"alcoholic Ribena and I've tried upping the gin and reducing the cassis to make drier e.g. 40ml Gin, 30ml Dry vermouth and 20ml Crème de cassis. However, this is best served with equal parts as a dessert Martini at its rich and indulgent best.",
  "History": "A classic cocktail named after the pre-war French pianist, singer and stage actress Yvonne Arnaud (1890-1958). A concert pianist as a child she went on to act in musical comedies before switching to non-musical comedy and drama around 1920. She then took dramatic cinematic roles during the 1930s and 40s, continuing to act into the 1950s.",
