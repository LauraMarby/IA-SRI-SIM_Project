  "Name": "Absinthe Drip Cocktail (Czech method)",
  "Glass": "Absinthe glass or old-fashioned glass",
  "Ingredients": [
    "45 ml La Fée Parisienne absinthe",
    "60 ml Chilled water",
    "1 cube Caster/ Superfine/Baker's special sugar (white)"
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    "BEWARE: please take care. Flames and alcohol are a dangerous combination!.\r\nPlace a sugar cube on a slotted absinthe spoon resting across the top of the glass. POUR the absinthe over the sugar cube into the glass. Light the absinthe-soaked cube and leave it to burn and caramelise. Using a bottle of chilled mineral water with a small hole in the cap, DRIP water over what's left of the sugar so it dissolves and drips into the glass. Add ice, stir, and serve."

  "Review": "More about the theatrics involved in its making than the taste of the finished drink.",
  "History": "This supposedly bohemian method of serving absinthe became popular back in 1998 with the UK launch of Hill's Absinthe . Accordingly, if you are going to make this drink, then it is best to use a Czech-style absinthe such as La Fée Bohemian .",
