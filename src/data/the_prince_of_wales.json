  "History": "Recipe adapted from David Wondrich's 2007 masterpiece Imbibe in which David tells the story of his Highness Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Queen Victoria and his mastering of this riff on the Improved Whisky Cocktail . Born 9th November 1841, he wasn't crowned King Edward VII until 9th August 1902 (ascended 22nd January 1901) and by all accounts made the most of his 60 years as an understudy by becoming a playboy and travelling the world. In 1860, he became the first British royal to visit North America and it is thought this cocktail resulted from the trip.",
