  "Review": "Clean, crisp, and fresh - gin-laced orange zesty citrus with herbal vermouth mellowed by smoothing egg white.",
  "History": "Recipe adapted from Albert Stevens Crockett's 1935 The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book which originally calls for \"orange gin\" rather than an orange liqueur. Crockett says the drink \"celebrated the local opening of Edmond Rostand's Chanticler \". Edmond Rostand was a French poet and dramatist, best known for his play Cyrano de Bergerac . First released in 1910, Chantecler (correct spelling) is a story where the characters are based on barnyard animals, and whose eponymous protagonist is a rooster who believes that his song makes the sun rise. By all accounts, the cocktail is rather better than the play. Incidentally, the Chantecler is actually a breed of chicken developed in the early 20th century by Brother Wilfred Chantelain, a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Canada.",
