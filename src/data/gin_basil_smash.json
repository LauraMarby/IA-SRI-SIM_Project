  "Review": "Jörg, the creator of this cocktail, says, \" Better too much than not enough basil in this drink \". He also specifies that the basil is muddled rather than just broken by the action of shaking as this produces a greener drink. He adds \" Keep in mind:  5 cl Gin is not enough; 6 cl Gin is the recipe; 7 cl Gin is LOVE! \"",
  "History": "Created in the summer of 2008 by Jörg Meyer at Le Lion • Bar de Paris , Hamburg, Germany and originally named Gin Pesto. Jörg blogged about his new creation on the 10th of July 2008 and from that point, it started to quickly grow in popularity to become internationally known, also becoming better known as the Gin Basil Smash.",
