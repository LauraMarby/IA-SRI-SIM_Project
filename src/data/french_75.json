  "Review": "Fresh, clean, sophisticated – dangerously quaffable. The use of powdered sugar instead of sugar syrup adds an attractive sherbet note to this cocktail. However, the drink also works well with sugar syrup – use ¼oz/7.5ml sugar syrup in place of the 1½ spoons of powdered sugar.",
  "History": "Prior to the 1980s/90s, the French 75 cocktail was a long cocktail, served in an ice-filled Collins glass. This modern flute serve has become the norm while the Collins version has been all but forgotten. See: French 75 history .",
