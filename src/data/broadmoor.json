  "Review": "Bartending law stipulates that this cocktail be stirred. If law-abiding, stir and serve on the rocks with larger (60ml whisky, 15ml Chartreuse, 10ml sugar, and 2 dashes bitters) measures. However, this digestif is best enjoyed straight-up while still alive and foaming from a good shake.",
  "History": "Named after the infamous British mental institution, this recipe is adapted from a cocktail created in 2001 by Swedish bartender Andreas Noren at The Player bar in London, England. It was then popularised at London's Milk & Honey club.",
