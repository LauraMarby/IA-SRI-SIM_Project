    "Select and pre-chill a Martini glass .",
    "Prepare garnish of lemon zest twist.",
    "INFUSE gin with black tea (preferably Earl Grey). Rather than infuse a whole bottle, you can instead pour just 120ml (4oz) dry gin (enough for two cocktails) into a small glass with one Earl Grey tea bag for 5 minutes at room temperature to achieve the desired flavour extraction. (Any longer and tannins can be overly dominant.)",

    "DRY SHAKE (without ice) to emulsify.",
    "FINE STRAIN into chilled glass.",
    "EXPRESS lemon zest twist over the cocktail and use as garnish."
