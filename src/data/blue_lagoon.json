  "Review": "Lurid blue, easy-drinking zesty citrusy. This cocktail is also known as The Swimming Pool and lounging beside one, or at least imagining you are, is what this cocktail is about.",
  "History": "There are two versions of this bright blue cocktail, both rather better than the film of the same name which despite being panned by the critics was the 9th-highest-grossing film of 1980. Perhaps a young Brooke Shields and a sexually charged plot set on a tropical island paradise helped. But I digress. Back to the drink. There's also a blended version (see variation) created either sometime in the 1960s, or more specifically in 1972, by Andy MacElhone (son of Harry) at Harry's New York Bar, Paris, France. We're unaware of anyone claiming to have created this built-in-the-glass/shaken (perhaps later) version of the Blue Lagoon but due to its simplicity, this is now the popular version.",
