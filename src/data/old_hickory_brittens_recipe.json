  "History": "Adapted from a 2017 recipe by Maxwell Britten at Maison Premiere, Brooklyn, NYC, USA. Britten's drink is riff from the Old Hickory cocktail in Stanley Clisby Arthur's 1937 Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix 'Em . 'Old Hickory' was the nickname of Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the USA (1829 to 1837) and founder of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Jackson was a general in the U.S. army who, despite orders to the contrary, in 1812 led his soldiers on a long march from New Orleans to Nashville with a toughness of discipline and resolve that drove his men to start calling him Hickory, a name that stuck and later became Old Hickory. To quote Famous Old New Orleans Drinks , \"When General Andrew Jackson was in New Orleans helping pirate Jean Lafitte win the Battle of New Orleans in the winter of 1814-15, this was his favourite tipple.\"",
