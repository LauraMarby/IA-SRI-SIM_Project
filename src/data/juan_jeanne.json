  "Review": "Tequila-based with sour citrus balanced by the rich red wine-like berry flavours of cassis.",
  "History": "Adapted from a recipe created in 2017 by Jeff Berry at Beachbum Berry's Latitude 29 , New Orleans, USA which was brought to our attention by gazregan.com where we learnt that \"A Mexican base + a French modifier = Juan + Jeanne.\" Our recipe says broadly true to Jeff's original proportions, but we've reduced all the ingredients by 12% to suit a medium-sized coupe.",
