  "Review": "Traditionally made 1/3 cassis to 2/3 wine, that's too sweet for most modern palates. We recommend a ratio of one part cassis to between five and seven parts Bourgogne Aligoté white wine. The above formula is 6:1 and at this concentration, the mix of blackcurrant and wine is clean, crisp and not too sweet.",
  "History": "The Kir Apéritif is thought to have first been mixed in 1904 by a waiter called Faivre at the Café George, 42 Rue de Montchapet, Dijon, France. It is named after Canon Félix Kir, who as the Mayor of Dijon promoted the drink by serving at civic functions. Kir and Kir Royale history",
