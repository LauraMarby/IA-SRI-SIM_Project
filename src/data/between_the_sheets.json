  "Review": "The classic proportions for a Between the Sheets are most often quoted as being: 30ml (1oz) Light rum 30ml (1oz) Cognac brandy 30ml (1oz) Triple sec liqueur 7.5ml (¼oz) Lemon juice That's three full shots of 40% liquor and a splash of lemon juice, which makes for a punchy cocktail that's just a touch on the tart side. My recipe uses a more manageable 67.5ml (2¼oz) of liquor (25% less) whilst broadly maintaining the classic proportions with just a touch of sugar (triple secs are drier these days) and saline to season.",
  "History": "Between The Sheets probably originated as a gin and rum-based cocktail (during Prohibition ) in America and then travelled to Europe where brandy was used in place of gin to make it more Sidecar -like. Although, this theory is upset by those who cite a Mr Polly of London's Berkeley Hotel as having created this cocktail in 1921. Timeline: Between The Sheets first appeared in print in Frank Shay's 1929 Drawn From The Wood with a recipe that calls for gin rather than brandy.",
