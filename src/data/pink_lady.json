  "Review": "A generous measure of gin and high-proof applejack provide spirituous spice which, along with lemon juice sourness, ensures that this cocktail is neither sweet nor weak. Indeed, this is a very tasty sour. So tasty, that to spare this Lady's blushes, our friend Ted \"Dr Cocktail\" Haigh would prefer you refer to it as \"The Secret Cocktail\".",
