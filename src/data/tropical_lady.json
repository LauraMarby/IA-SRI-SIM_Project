  "Review": "Making the above recipe we found ourselves pondering why the 5ml of sugar syrup was not incorporated in to the banana paste. The finished drink is basically a banana and maraschino influenced aged rum daiquiri.",
  "History": "Created for Bacardí Legacy 2017 by Ludovico De Biaggi at BASA Basement Bar & Restaurant, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Inspiration : “Tropical Lady is an elegant Tiki cocktail, inspired by family and the Latin spirit of sharing. My parents are bar and restaurant owners in Buenos Aires and since I was very young they taught me the importance of sharing moments and knowledge to make a legacy endure. “They share the passion of doing what they love; it is that same passion that drives me to always be searching. My cocktail is part of that search and I have the pleasure of sharing it with you.”",
