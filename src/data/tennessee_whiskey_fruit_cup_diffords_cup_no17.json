  "Review": "Arguably, when numbering my fruit cups, I left the best till last. (I skipped number 16 because the number 7 so befits a Tennessee whiskey-based cocktail). If using a 40% alc./vol. Tennessee whiskey (as opposed to a higher alc./vol. special bottling) then this recipe benefits from an extra splash (5ml (1/6oz) to 10ml (1/3oz). Tennessee whiskey adds an appealing sweet toasty note to this fruit cup.",
  "History": "Created in June 2017 by yours truly at the Cabinet Room, London, England. For more recipes and history see Fruit Cups and Pimm's .",
