  "Review": "A rum-laced banana milkshake dirtied by coffee liqueur. The riper the banana used in this cocktail, the better. (Brown spots on the banana skin = tasty cocktail.) This cocktail makes for a filling dessert, so consider splitting this recipe between two 10oz Highball glasses and sharing with a friend. Or for a smaller single-serve: Dirty Banana (half-sized recipe) Glass: Highball (6oz - 10oz /18cl - 30cl) Garnish: Banana chunk on rim Method: BLEND all ingredients with half 6oz scoop crushed ice. 30ml (1oz) Light rum (mellow white/gold 1-3 year old) 15ml (½oz) Coffee liqueur 15ml (½oz) Crème de banana 30ml (1oz) Single cream/half-and-half 1/2 fresh Banana (peeled)",
