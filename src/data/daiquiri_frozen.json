  "Review": "A superbly refreshing cocktail on a hot day. Blend with too much ice and you will have a tasteless slushy drink that will give you brain-ache if you drink it too fast. Traditionally, in Cuba, this cocktail was strained through a sieve to remove the ice.",
  "History": "Emilio Gonzalez is said to have adapted a shaken \"Natural\" Daiquiri to make a frozen (blended) Daiquiri at the Plaza Hotel in Cuba. However, Constantino Ribalaigua Vert of Havana's Floridita bar made the drink famous. The electric blender was invented in 1919 and popularised in the 1930s. This recipe by yours truly.
