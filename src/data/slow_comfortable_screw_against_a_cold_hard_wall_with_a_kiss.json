  "Review": "The float of amaretto adds the \"Kiss\" to a Slow Comfortable Screw Against a Cold Hard Wall . If this was served in a Tiki mug it would be a Tiki Drink rather than a Disco Drink – it's fruity and boozy, and just edging towards the sweet side with that splash of amaretto adding rich almond notes.",
